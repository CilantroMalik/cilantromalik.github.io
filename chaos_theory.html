hi!  
  
what you&#39;re (hopefully) about to read is an interactive piece that explores a snapshot of a life. I hazard that this experience may not be _enjoyable_, in the traditional sense, but I hope, nevertheless, that it proves worthwhile, in whatever way you may define it.

[[begin-&gt;waking up]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="waking up" tags="" position="225,1000" size="100,100">your eyes open slowly, forced from sleep by the sheer force of a cacophony of all-too-familiar sound waves. through the gap in the curtains in your room, you see the glassy obsidian of a night sky behind a window panel, just as dark as you left it mere hours ago. 

come to think of it, you don&#39;t even remember when exactly you got into bed last night. the monotonicity of the sky has a habit of messing with your perception of time, seconds turning into minutes and then hours as the inky blackness of the sky seems to swell and secede in stasis. you don&#39;t remember how long you spent sitting at your desk by the window before you finally gave up, but you tell yourself that you probably found a stopping point before it got too late.

your inner monologue, however, is far from convincing. you know all too well how that darkness can suck you in, because it&#39;s too easy to drag on and on when the blank obsidian canvas before you paints an illusion of stillness in a world that, nevertheless, refuses to stop moving.

the alarm reminds you that time is still passing. you&#39;ve got to get ready, and as much as you want to let its slipstream rush by, [[you move forward-&gt;out of bed]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="out of bed" tags="" position="350,1000" size="100,100">despite the weight of a gravity well that seems to get stronger every day, you lift your shoulders off the bed. you can&#39;t help but think that as you grow older, it&#39;ll become harder and harder to overcome the increasing pull. images flash through your head of a morning not unlike this one, where you&#39;re forced to resign to your own mind, forced to lie here in a prison you made but can&#39;t find the strength to escape. but that won&#39;t happen as long as you can help it, right? you tell yourself, and you feel guilty just the same, because what kind of person are you, having everything—a comfortable bed to sleep in, a house in the suburbs, a group of friends that would support you through anything—to lie in bed, defeated, lacking the resolve to forge your path through the thick fog on the horizon?

yet, gravity, the weakest of the four fundamental forces, is still unimaginably strong. and you know that if you let up, you&#39;ll fall. down, down, down, into the deepest recesses of your own guilt.

what kind of person are you?

you don&#39;t want to answer this question. so, as you always have, you outrun it. propping yourself up on your feet, you walk around the bed towards your closet to get ready, leaving the specter at your bedside. it&#39;ll catch up to you soon, but not yet. you relish the moment, and [[move forward-&gt;at the window]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="at the window" tags="" position="475,1000" size="100,100">morningMath: &quot;none&quot;

you pass by your desk. unconsciously slowing down, you glance at its polished wooden surface, mostly obscured by sticky notes and pieces of paper strewn in meticulously created chaos. after years of practice your eye has become adept at scanning the wreckage, divining some semblance of organization from the disarray that inevitably results from a night of attempts at multitasking. 

you&#39;re momentarily taken back to last night, recounting the circuitous path you took to arrive at this seeming mess of half-finished assignments, and as you mentally tally up everything you&#39;ve got to finish this morning, you notice a slanted sliver of chromaticism projecting onto your desk, casting a line of orange on the stark grayscale of homework left undone. you push the curtains out of the way of the window and gaze out into the finally awakening world. 

the sun is rising, painting the bare trees reds and oranges and purples with ephemeral brush strokes. you&#39;ve always loved watching the sunrise, watching through your window a window into a microcosm ninety-three million miles away. you&#39;ve always loved to witness the sun saturating the silent sky with striations of scarlet, temporarily forgetting that these colors only exist for a brief, liminal moment. every sunrise is a bit different, reflecting the unique conditions of the day it heralds into being, signaling the constant march of time—the antithesis to the nondescript nature of night.

you desperately want to stay at the window and watch the sun work its magic. its top edge is already peeking over the horizon, barely visible between the trees. but you have work to do before school. alas, you weren&#39;t productive enough last night, and even as those papers on your desk taunt you with reflections of the colors you so wish you could be absorbed in, you know that you probably should do your work.  

[if passage.visits &gt; 1]
the weight of timelines past tugs at you, conjuring up images of days at once familiar and foreign. you feel like you&#39;ve been here before, standing at this window, making this choice. but try as you might to call on this imagined history, it won&#39;t help you make this decision. the past is behind you, and you don&#39;t have time to go back and catch it. you&#39;ll have to do this alone.

you&#39;ll finish your work later, you&#39;ll be extra efficient, you say. your mind needs a rest. you lean on the window and let gravity take its course.  

the chromaticism enthralls you. although the student in the back of your mind pulls you towards the unfinished assignments that clutter your desk, the human inside you needs this moment, this small reminder that time continues to pass despite our best efforts to arrest it, that dawn continues its cyclic circumnavigations of the globe despite what seem like endlessly interminable nights.  

after what very well could have been hours, the sun has cleared the horizon, shifting hues from incandescent orange to its more neutral yellow. it disappears behind the mangled thicket of branches, swallowed by a forest overstory ravaged by the exigencies of a continental winter. your eyes find the tiny spot that remains visible through the maze of twisted wood, and you contemplate the fact that this star, which occupies such a small fraction of the sky&#39;s seemingly infinite area, illuminates the entirety of its cosmic canvas. and even as thoughts surface, thoughts about impact and meaning and transience, you know you&#39;ll have to save those for later. because just as the sun rises ever higher, insistent to reach its peak, you too must walk your path. turning away from the window, you [[get ready for school-&gt;get ready after sunrise]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="get ready" tags="" position="600,1500" size="100,100">watchedSunrise: &quot;no&quot;

the student in you gets the better of your desire, and you turn away from the window. the sun&#39;s nascent light beating at the back of your neck with the force of a missed opportunity, you go through the motions of the morning, oscillating from the closet to the bathroom to, finally, your desk.

you have _so_ much work left to finish. you close the curtains so the sunrise won&#39;t distract you, but its intensity still bleeds through the semi-opaque sheets of fabric that lie between you and a moment that could have been. you tell yourself that because you&#39;ve skipped out on watching the sunrise, you&#39;d better finish all of your work to make up for it.

but what to start with? you can&#39;t just make spontaneous decisions. randomness is regret, a missed opportunity to make a more optimal decision, so you methodically enumerate your options.

option 1: work on the math homework, due third period. you haven&#39;t walked into math class empty-handed since seventh grade, and you&#39;d really rather not let up now. besides, it probably won&#39;t take that long, and this unit is hard, so you know you could use the practice.

option 2: finish revising and editing the english paper, due last period. you love to write, but the revision process is emotionally exhausting, as you inevitably part with words and phrases to which you&#39;ve become attached in the name of streamlining your prose. you could probably finish during the day if you did something else now, but you&#39;d almost definitely have to skip lunch to do so. it&#39;d be far from the first time you&#39;ve done that.

option 3: make some slides for the bio lab presentation, due second period. your groupmates have been working on most of the presentation so far, but you did most of the planning and design for the lab; you still feel like you haven&#39;t been pulling your weight, so you want to add some text and visuals for the parts that are still unfinished. you&#39;ve just been so swamped these past few days, and your groupmates will probably be happy to pick up the slack if you tell them you can&#39;t do it, but would you do that?

you don&#39;t even have to fish through the papers on your desk to find the problem set. the sheer density of minuscule pencil markings distinguishes it instantly to your eye, and you look over writing that only you could possibly understand, getting into the frame of mind you were in at the unnamed hour of last night when you started this. you begin working the problems, alternating between scribbling barely fast enough to keep up with your brain and pausing to ponder and give your hand a break. eventually, after a surprisingly short time, you&#39;re done. 

math has always been fun for you, the healthy challenge of difficult problems a welcome jolt of exhilaration in an often dreary homework session. but today it&#39;s a little different, because you feel the weight of the choices you didn&#39;t make bear down on you, the pull of timelines that could have been threatening to tear you apart. you regret not working on your english paper, because you hate to hand in work that you know could be better, and you hate yourself for not contributing to your bio project, because you imagine your groupmates checking the lab presentation and frantically finishing the slides they realize you haven&#39;t done. the guilt of letting people down sets in, even though you realize that you&#39;ll never be able to make the english paper good enough to pass your astronomically high standards, that you&#39;ve done a good amount of work for the lab presentation anyway and your groupmates will understand and be okay picking up the slack. rationality is weak, and indeed, it doesn&#39;t make the reality any better.

you know that you&#39;ll get lost in pondering the endless maze of bifurcating timelines, hopelessly ensnared in a room of distorted mirrors, reflections on your inevitably imperfect choices. you console yourself by asserting that sacrifices must be made, but even as you attempt to pitch this admittedly weak argument to yourself, your mind fights back with regret, a virus worming through your brain, corrupting your nascent memories of the beautiful sunrise with the tarnish of hindsight.

amidst the chaos, a notification pops up on your phone, and you check the time. the bus will stop at your house in no less than ten minutes. if you pack up your things now and leave your bedroom, you could eat breakfast with barely enough time to get to school. but if you forgo breakfast, you could maybe, just maybe, make some headway on one of your remaining assignments. as your grandmother has always told you, breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but you feel like you&#39;ve got to try. the fact that it&#39;s got here is your fault, isn&#39;t it? you didn&#39;t budget your time well enough. you chose to watch the sunrise instead of doing work. why should your essay and lab group have to pay for that?

you pull out a fairly thick stack of papers from the back of your desk and shuffle them to the front. for some reason, you&#39;ve chosen to finish this english essay on paper, maybe because you like the tactile feeling of crossing out and writing and inserting and seeing the footprints of essays that might have been, physically represented in neatly cast graphite. 

beginning to comb through your characteristically dense prose, already peppered with customarily self-deprecating comments, you gradually become absorbed in the minutiae of the essay—the flow of the sentences, the sound of certain words, the depth of the analysis. you&#39;re a perfectionist, and you know it, but this knowledge doesn&#39;t preclude you from hopelessly throwing yourself into the revision process every time. somewhere, in the back of your mind, you wonder why you&#39;re even doing this, because you know that you&#39;ll never be happy with the product. nevertheless, you keep going.

you feel good about the choice you&#39;ve made, because you hate to be the one who contributes the least to the group project. you log into your account and visit the slideshow, only to see that since last night, your groupmates have finished all but two of the slides. 

a wave of guilt washes over you as you take a cursory look at the version history and realize that they must have stayed up quite late to do that, all because you didn&#39;t prioritize this project earlier and instead spent the time to finish all your other work, all because you didn&#39;t stay up later, all because you just couldn&#39;t be efficient enough with your time.

you tell yourself that you&#39;d better finish these quickly to make up for it. you pull out your notes and write out the text, then find some fitting images and tweak the layout, and the presentation is done. you send your groupmates an email apologizing for your lack of involvement, but it&#39;s not enough. you feel the weight of the choices you didn&#39;t make bear down on you, the pull of timelines that could have been threatening to tear you apart. you regret not working on your problem set, because you know you&#39;d have enjoyed it more and hate to walk into class unprepared; and you regret not working on your english paper, because you hate to hand in work that you know could be better. the guilt of letting people down sets in, even though you realize that you&#39;ll never be able to make the english paper good enough to pass your astronomically high standards, that your math teacher won&#39;t be mad because this&#39;ll be the first time in the three years he&#39;s had you that you&#39;ll come in without your homework. rationality is weak, and indeed, it doesn&#39;t make the reality any better.

you get your things together and run downstairs. your grandmother has already prepared breakfast for you, so, out of breath, you thank her and begin eating. as you stare blankly at the counter, a skirmish breaks out in your mind.

the other part of you feels a dangerous fear you can&#39;t quite place. it&#39;s the familiar but elusive fear of a reality that never was. this time, it&#39;s the fear of an alternate timeline in which you skip breakfast and have to run straight to the bus, leaving your grandmother waiting for you, food on the table and hope slowly fading until she realizes you&#39;re gone. even though this timeline doesn&#39;t exist, and never will, it still feels so real, still feels like a choice you could have, and maybe should have, made. and that reality, however nonreal it may be, scares you.

all roads lead back to guilt. you&#39;ve learned this time and time again, but unlike the material you&#39;re learning in your classes, it never seems to stick, never seems to teach you anything. but you can&#39;t afford to wallow in it now. the bus is fast approaching, so, wading through a turbulent sea of thoughts, waves of guilt and frustration and helplessness and inadequacy battering your mental frame, you [[make your way outside-&gt;outside waiting for bus]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="no sunrise bio after m + e" tags="" position="975,1125" size="100,100">morningBio: &quot;others finished&quot;

even though the specter of your grandmother looms large in your mind, you feel good about the choice you&#39;ve made, because you hate to be the one who contributes the least to the group project. you log into your account and visit the slideshow, only to see that since last night, your groupmates have finished all of the slides.

a wave of guilt washes over you as you take a cursory look at the version history and realize that they must have stayed up quite late to finish most of the presentation, leaving only two slides for you. then, this morning, while you were pulled too far into english (a choice you now regret), they wrote up those two as well. you&#39;re too late—all because you didn&#39;t prioritize this project earlier and instead spent the time to finish all your other work, all because you didn&#39;t stay up later, all because you got carried away and just couldn&#39;t be efficient enough with your time.

you send your groupmates a long email apologizing for your lack of involvement, but it&#39;s not enough. you try to distract yourself by pulling back out your english paper, which you still feel like you need to edit further, but it&#39;s not enough. your mind won&#39;t let you go.

your phone snaps you out of the crashing cascade of guilt, vibrating vehemently with the daily signal that the bus will be here in a minute. you hurriedly stuff your belongings into your bag, and, wading through the turbulent sea of thoughts, waves of frustration and anger and guilt and inadequacy battering your mental frame, you [[make your way outside-&gt;outside waiting for bus]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="no sunrise math 2 after e + m" tags="" position="1225,1350" size="100,100">even as part of you is enjoying the intellectual challenge of tackling this problem, a much louder sector of your mind is berating you for letting down your groupmates. you imagine them taking a look at the slideshow now or soon, wanting to make sure it&#39;s ready before class, and seeing that you still haven&#39;t done your slides. they frantically finish them, and who knows what other tasks they&#39;ll have to forgo to do it? you dread having to explain to them that you just had too much going on, because they&#39;re too nice to be mad at you, but that won&#39;t diminish the fact that you&#39;ve failed them nonetheless.

you can&#39;t work on your problem set.

you can&#39;t work on anything.

you&#39;re paralyzed with the guilt of a bad decision.

minutes pass, and before you know it, your phone snaps you out of it, vibrating vehemently with the daily signal that the bus will be here in a minute. you hurriedly stuff your belongings into your bag, and, wading through the turbulent sea of thoughts, waves of frustration and anger and guilt and inadequacy battering your mental frame, you [[make your way outside-&gt;outside waiting for bus]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="outside waiting for bus" tags="" position="1400,1000" size="100,100">you stand at the base of your driveway, feeling the full force of the frigid winter air. you almost wish the wind would carry you away, wish a concentrated gust would sweep you into nothingness—but the acute sting of the cold, the dull throbbing of layers of guilt racking your already overburdened mind, and the unmistakable sound of a bus hurtling down the hill towards your house tether you to this world, for better or for worse. the bus pulls up and the doors open, inviting you to step inside, and so you do. the doors sweep shut behind you, pushing one last breath of cold air into the bus&#39;s interior, and you collapse on a seat. the bus&#39;s small cavity is oppressive, but you&#39;re glad for the reprieve from the cold outside, and as motion returns to your chilled hands, the bus begins tracing its daily path to school. 

even though something tells you that you have things to do, your mind shuts down, lulling you into an all-too-familiar state of panic masquerading as calm. the events of the morning circulate inside you like a volatile high-pressure storm system, whipping previously static air into a frantic whirlwind that sucks any semblance of coherent thought into its chaotic dance. you close your eyes and push everything down the road, down the winding residential streets and two-lane arterials and frenetic freeways that await you. time slows down, and you retreat into your shell, protecting yourself from one storm and exposing yourself to another.

you don&#39;t even have to fish through the papers on your desk to find the problem set. the sheer density of minuscule pencil markings distinguishes it instantly to your eye, and you look over writing that only you could possibly understand, getting into the frame of mind you were in at the unnamed hour of last night when you started this. you begin working the problems, alternating between scribbling barely fast enough to keep up with your brain and pausing to ponder and give your hand a break. math has always been fun for you, the healthy challenge of difficult problems a welcome jolt of exhilaration in an often dreary homework session, but now, under time pressure and with the specter of your grandmother looking sternly over your shoulder, you&#39;re not sure if you&#39;ll be able to find the same joy as you always have.

you&#39;re working on the second-to-last problem. it&#39;s marked with an asterisk, particularly challenging, but you see this as an invitation. you normally love a nice challenge, but now, you can&#39;t seem to get into the right headspace. you tell yourself that you&#39;ve got to finish, because after all, you skipped breakfast for this. you won&#39;t let your guilt get the better of you.

a few minutes later, you&#39;ve solved the problem. it doesn&#39;t feel great. you gain no satisfaction from this, and even as you quickly polish off the last problem and check over your work, you consciously realize that this isn&#39;t the math experience you&#39;re used to. part of you thinks that maybe you should have eaten breakfast instead—but then you look at the completed problem set, and another part of you insists that you&#39;d be regretting not doing this if you chose to eat. you let the hypotheticals dissipate, because you&#39;ll never know. 

one question lingers, though. you didn&#39;t enjoy this one bit, whether because of the rush or the less than ideal choices you&#39;ve made. so was it worth it? should you have stopped and grabbed something to eat? but more importantly, if you had known you wouldn&#39;t be able to fully engage with the work, should you have skipped it entirely?

your phone helpfully dispels these questions, vibrating vehemently with the daily signal that the bus will be here in a minute. you hurriedly stuff your belongings into your bag, and, wading through the turbulent sea of thoughts, waves of guilt and trepidation battering your mental frame, you [[make your way outside-&gt;outside waiting for bus]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="no sunrise breakfast after b + e" tags="" position="1100,1850" size="100,100">breakfast: &quot;yes&quot;

you get your things together and run downstairs. your grandmother has already prepared breakfast for you, so, out of breath, you thank her and begin eating. as you stare blankly at the counter, a skirmish breaks out in your mind.

one part of you feels guilt. you imagine walking into math class, directionless for the first time in years, lacking the unnoticed yet indispensable guiding force that is, well, doing the homework. you know your teacher won&#39;t be mad—after all, he&#39;s had you for three years and this is the first time you&#39;ve shirked your duties—but even though you know he&#39;ll understand, the fact is that you&#39;ll come into class unprepared. there&#39;s nothing you can do to change it now, so you&#39;ll just have to face the consequences. you feel a glass ceiling that has held for more than half a decade slowly giving way, spiderweb cracks snaking their way across its smooth surface—or maybe it&#39;s a glass floor, and you&#39;re about to fall through, down its slippery slope.

the other part of you feels a dangerous fear you can&#39;t quite place. it&#39;s the familiar but elusive fear of a reality that never was. this time, it&#39;s the fear of an alternate timeline in which you skip breakfast and have to run straight to the bus, leaving your grandmother waiting for you, food on the table and hope slowly fading until she realizes you&#39;re gone. even though this timeline doesn&#39;t exist, and never will, it still feels so real, still feels like a choice you could have, and maybe should have, made. and that reality, however nonreal it may be, scares you.

you pull out a fairly thick stack of papers from the back of your desk and shuffle them to the front. for some reason, you&#39;ve chosen to finish this english essay on paper, maybe because you like the tactile feeling of crossing out and writing and inserting and seeing the footprints of essays that might have been, physically represented in neatly cast graphite. 

beginning to comb through your characteristically dense prose, already peppered with customarily self-deprecating comments, you gradually become absorbed in the minutiae of the essay—the flow of the sentences, the sound of certain words, the depth of the analysis. you&#39;re a perfectionist, and you know it, but this knowledge doesn&#39;t preclude you from hopelessly throwing yourself into the revision process every time. 

somewhere, in the back of your mind, you wonder why you&#39;re even doing this, because you know that you&#39;ll never be happy with the product. and as if by some cruel coincidence, this thought invades your mind just as you raise your wrist to check your watch. you brace yourself for time to enact one of its twisted tricks.

and so it does. the bus will stop at your house in no less than ten minutes. if you pack up your things now and leave your bedroom, you could eat breakfast with barely enough time to get to school. but you&#39;ll have to hand in your english paper in its current state—unless you forgo breakfast and use these precious few minutes to revise a bit further. as your grandmother has always told you, breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but you feel like you owe it to yourself and your teacher to put your all into this essay. part of you knows that this process will mercilessly consume any and all time you give it, but another part of you you insists that the essay can be better. it must be better.

but, no matter how much better you make it, no matter how smoothly the sentences blend into one another, how precise the diction, how imagistic the language, will you ever be happy?

can you ever be happy?

should you ever be happy?

you don&#39;t know. but maybe you should try.

so you try. you spend these tense minutes poring over a few passages that your racing mind has flagged for improvement, frantically permuting words, relentlessly testing syntactic shuffles and content changes, hurriedly streamlining the prosody for maximum emotional impact. and even though it&#39;s still not done—never done—you feel a little better because you&#39;ve put in the extra effort. 

the ever-present voice in the back of your mind, always questioning, asks whether your teacher will really notice the extra eight minutes you spent. and you realize that you really did this for yourself—not for your teacher, not for your grade, not for your end-of-term comments. you did this to placate the fire that consumes you, the fire of perfectionism, constantly animating you to pursue ever higher heights, even as altitude sickness begs you to stop ascending. but all you really did was throw more fuel in the fire, so it can burn even brighter next time.

you get your things together and run downstairs. your grandmother has already prepared breakfast for you, so, out of breath, you thank her and begin eating. as you stare blankly at the counter, a skirmish breaks out in your mind.

one part of you feels guilt. your english teacher has always had high expectations for you, but more pressingly, you&#39;ve always had astronomically high expectations for yourself. whether it stems from an upbringing that constantly pushed you to be better no matter what, from an inflated sense of your abilities, or from a bit of both. you feel like handing a paper without putting your best effort constitutes letting her, and yourself, down. taking no pleasure in the act of eating (and feeling guilty just the same, because your grandmother has put effort into making the food for you), you wonder if you should&#39;ve just worked a bit more on the paper. there were some subpar sections, after all. there are always subpar sections.

the other part of you feels a dangerous fear you can&#39;t quite place. it&#39;s the familiar but elusive fear of a reality that never was. this time, it&#39;s the fear of an alternate timeline in which you skip breakfast and have to run straight to the bus, leaving your grandmother waiting for you, food on the table and hope slowly fading until she realizes you&#39;re gone. even though this timeline doesn&#39;t exist, and never will, it still feels so real, still feels like a choice you could have, and maybe should have, made. and that reality, however nonreal it may be, scares you.

you send your groupmates a long email apologizing for your lack of involvement, but it&#39;s not enough. you try to distract yourself by pulling out your english paper, which you still need to revise, but it&#39;s not enough. your mind won&#39;t let you go.

your phone snaps you out of the crashing cascade of guilt, vibrating vehemently with the daily signal that the bus will be here in a minute. you hurriedly stuff your belongings into your bag, and, wading through the turbulent sea of thoughts, waves of frustration and anger and guilt and inadequacy battering your mental frame, you [[make your way outside-&gt;outside waiting for bus]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="37" name="sunrise breakfast after e" tags="" position="1100,425" size="100,100">breakfast: &quot;yes&quot;

you get your things together and run downstairs. your grandmother has already prepared breakfast for you, so, out of breath, you thank her and begin eating. as you stare blankly at the counter, a skirmish breaks out in your mind.

one part of you feels guilt. you know you&#39;ll have to go to math class with an incomplete problem set, and even though your teacher won&#39;t get mad, since this is the first time in the three years you&#39;ve had him that you&#39;ve skipped the homework, you feel like you&#39;ve let him—and yourself—down. and you imagine your groupmates taking a look at the slideshow now or soon, wanting to make sure it&#39;s ready before class, and seeing that you still haven&#39;t done your slides. they frantically finish them, and who knows what other tasks they&#39;ll have to forgo to do it? you dread having to explain to them that you just had too much going on, because they&#39;re too nice to be mad at you, but that won&#39;t diminish the fact that you&#39;ve failed them nonetheless.

the other part of you feels a dangerous fear you can&#39;t quite place. it&#39;s the familiar but elusive fear of a reality that never was. this time, it&#39;s the fear of an alternate timeline in which you skip breakfast and have to run straight to the bus, leaving your grandmother waiting for you, food on the table and hope slowly fading until she realizes you&#39;re gone. even though this timeline doesn&#39;t exist, and never will, it still feels so real, still feels like a choice you could have, and maybe should have, made. and that reality, however nonreal it may be, scares you.

all roads lead back to guilt. you&#39;ve learned this time and time again, but unlike the material you&#39;re learning in your classes, it never seems to stick, never seems to teach you anything. but you can&#39;t afford to wallow in it now. the bus is fast approaching, so, wading through a turbulent sea of thoughts, waves of guilt and frustration and helplessness and inadequacy battering your mental frame, you [[make your way outside-&gt;outside waiting for bus]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="38" name="sunrise more english after e" tags="" position="975,575" size="100,100">morningEnglish: &quot;revised more&quot;

even as you mentally commit to spending these next few minutes grappling with this paper, the specter of your grandmother looms large in your mind, and you already begin to regret not choosing to do your other work or eating breakfast. part of you knows that this process will mercilessly consume any and all time you give it, but another part of you you insists that the essay can be better. it must be better.

but, no matter how much better you make it, no matter how smoothly the sentences blend into one another, how precise the diction, how imagistic the language, will you ever be happy?

can you ever be happy?

should you ever be happy?

you don&#39;t know. but maybe you should try.

so you try. you spend these tense minutes poring over a few passages that your racing mind has flagged for improvement, frantically permuting words, relentlessly testing syntactic shuffles and content changes, hurriedly streamlining the prosody for maximum emotional impact. and even though it&#39;s still not done—never done—you feel a little better because you&#39;ve put in the extra effort. 

the ever-present voice in the back of your mind, always questioning, asks whether your teacher will really notice the extra eight minutes you spent. and you realize that you really did this for yourself—not for your teacher, not for your grade, not for your end-of-term comments. you did this to placate the fire that consumes you, the fire of perfectionism, constantly animating you to pursue ever higher heights, even as altitude sickness begs you to stop ascending. but all you really did was throw more fuel in the fire, so it can burn even brighter next time.

but now is no time to meditate on next time. the bus is fast approaching, so, wading through a turbulent sea of thoughts, waves of guilt and frustration and helplessness and inadequacy battering your mental frame, you [[make your way outside-&gt;outside waiting for bus]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="39" name="sunrise bio after e" tags="" position="1100,575" size="100,100">morningBio: &quot;others finished&quot;

one part of you feels guilt. you know you&#39;ll have to hand in your english paper as is, and you know you could have improved it so maybe it&#39;d become as good as you want it to be. and you imagine walking into math class, directionless for the first time in years, lacking the unnoticed yet indispensable guiding force that is, well, doing the homework. you know your teacher won&#39;t be mad—after all, he&#39;s had you for three years and this is the first time you&#39;ve shirked your duties—but even though you know he&#39;ll understand, the fact is that you&#39;ll come into class unprepared. there&#39;s nothing you can do to change it now, so you&#39;ll just have to face the consequences. you feel a glass ceiling that has held for more than half a decade slowly giving way, spiderweb cracks snaking their way across its smooth surface—or maybe it&#39;s a glass floor, and you&#39;re about to fall through, down its slippery slope.

the other part of you feels a dangerous fear you can&#39;t quite place. it&#39;s the familiar but elusive fear of a reality that never was. this time, it&#39;s the fear of an alternate timeline in which you skip breakfast and have to run straight to the bus, leaving your grandmother waiting for you, food on the table and hope slowly fading until she realizes you&#39;re gone. even though this timeline doesn&#39;t exist, and never will, it still feels so real, still feels like a choice you could have, and maybe should have, made. and that reality, however nonreal it may be, scares you.

it&#39;s tough to switch gears so dramatically, but time pressure works wonders. closing your computer and pulling out a fairly thick stack of papers from the back of your desk, consciously trying to push out the specter of your grandmother that looms large in your mind, you transition into english mode. for some reason, you&#39;ve chosen to finish this essay on paper, maybe because you like the tactile feeling of crossing out and writing and inserting and seeing the footprints of essays that might have been, physically represented in neatly cast graphite. 

beginning to comb through your characteristically dense prose, already peppered with customarily self-deprecating comments, you gradually become absorbed in the minutiae of the essay—the flow of the sentences, the sound of certain words, the depth of the analysis. you&#39;re a perfectionist, and you know it, but this knowledge doesn&#39;t preclude you from hopelessly throwing yourself into the revision process every time. somewhere, in the back of your mind, you wonder why you&#39;re even doing this, because you know that you&#39;ll never be happy with the product. nevertheless, you keep going.

and going.

rain pours down in sheets, flooding your mind with a shapeshifting sea of questions. could you have made better choices? was eating breakfast the right judgment? could that time have been better reallocated? was it selfish to prioritize getting some amount of sleep and eating food over your assignments, responsibilities you have for people who&#39;ve put in so much effort for you? did you make too hasty a decision on what order to do your work in, and would more thorough deliberation have yielded a more optimal alternative? will you ever stop chasing perfection, that ideal obscured by the murky clouds of reality, or will you continue optimizing ever further? when is it time to stop? you don&#39;t know.

thunder roars in your mental echo chamber, doubt and regret reverberating throughout its claustrophobic cavity. though time has seemed to grind to a halt, your overactive mind continues racing at its breakneck pace, attempting to traverse every possible path, calculate every possible choice, exhaust every possible resource in this twisted game of chess. you know that this is unknowable, that you will never be able to rid yourself of the feeling of abstract regret for the infinitude of realities you will never experience, realities you locked yourself out of by your own choice. you look at yourself, and see the cascade of chaos that the morning&#39;s events have induced, and you can&#39;t help but wonder if, after all, you weren&#39;t made for this.

the temperatures plunge, sinister sheaves of ice snaking their way into the deepest layers of your emotional stronghold. they threaten to compromise its walls, barriers you&#39;ve meticulously built to keep those parts of you in check. you built those walls for a reason: to stop your emotions from running away, to prevent them from proliferating throughout your mind and body, to ensure that they never get in the way of productivity. you spent years learning how to hide from them, but years of life in such close proximity to this captive beast have cultivated in you a pathological fear that it&#39;ll escape. but you&#39;re not afraid of feeling—you&#39;ve always felt, and think a world without feeling would be meaningless. you&#39;re afraid that your emotions will cloud your capacity to take on seemingly endless work, to pack your schedule more full than should be possible, to race relentlessly with no end in sight. you&#39;re afraid that your emotions will snap you out of the carefully calibrated, constantly working state you&#39;ve barely left for years—and if you stop, could you ever start again? you don&#39;t know, and you don&#39;t want to try, because there&#39;s too much you need to do first. so you reinforce the walls, burying yourself deeper beneath layers of suppression, because you&#39;re afraid that your emotions will force you to acknowledge your humanity.

and if you were human—what human would put themselves through this?

what human would be able to endure this?

you don&#39;t know.

[[the storm rages on.-&gt;arriving at school]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="45" name="arriving at school" tags="" position="1650,1000" size="100,100">the end is in sight. even as you&#39;re consumed by the storm system that has detonated inside your mind, you are subconsciously aware that the bus has gotten off the highway. this means that only two or three minutes remain before you walk into the school building, as you do every weekday, and invariably squander the minute or two of buffer time before your classes start. you might try and finish a bit more work, you think, to make up for the disaster of the morning—but even before the thought has finished crossing your mind, the storm sweeps it up, ripping it to shreds with the full force of reality. you aren&#39;t getting anything done before school starts, because if you couldn&#39;t even finish everything in an entire morning, how will you do it now?

more importantly, you need this storm to subside. you can&#39;t go to school like this, with pieces of your normally tightly controlled self threatening to escape from their cells, aided by the chaos of a mind in disarray. you know that if you can&#39;t get your act together, people will ask you what&#39;s wrong, and you don&#39;t want them to have to hear the answer to that question. you know that you have to figure this out quickly, because you don&#39;t want to be the one darkening the mood, making your friends worry with your stubborn silence—a veil that, to those who know you, inevitably falls short of fully concealing the turmoil underneath. you know that you won&#39;t be able to hide for the whole day, so you&#39;d better get this under control. but, at the same time, you sense that the storm won&#39;t just evaporate that quickly. so you push it down, using all your meager strength to latch the gates shut, and you hope that your years of experience will pay off, that whatever strength you gave is enough.

you know that suppressing your emotions is wrong. yet it still seems like the best option. you either let everything out, crippling your ordinarily unyielding ability to work and more importantly creating unnecessary worry for your friends—or you take a bit more effort to contain yourself, eliminating both of those problems while only incurring an addition to your internal duties. you love your friends more than anything, and you have responsibilities to do your work, so the latter has always been the clear choice. you spent years practicing and honing your self-restraint to prepare for moments like these, and you&#39;re just hoping that training doesn&#39;t let you down.

as the bus doors open and you step out, another blast of cold air brings you back to the present. it&#39;s time for school, and you&#39;re ready. trying not to think about everything you haven&#39;t done, you walk into the building, quickly throw your bag into your locker, and [[head to homeroom-&gt;homeroom]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="46" name="homeroom" tags="" position="1775,1000" size="100,100">orchestraLateNote: &quot;no&quot;

speedwalking into homeroom, you see that everyone else is already there. your advisor says good morning, and you return the greeting. then you crumple into a seat and spend the next minute (though it seems like ten...) replaying the five-second encounter over and over in your head, hoping you didn&#39;t come across any different than usual. you don&#39;t think your advisor noticed anything—after all, why would she suspect anything out of the ordinary? it&#39;s just another day at school.

the net three minutes pass by in slow motion. you scold yourself for not using this time to do some work, and then you step back and wonder how you&#39;ve reached a point where you&#39;re angry at yourself for sitting down for _three minutes_ without being productive. you contemplate the force of your upbringing, the lasting influence of a mindset of constant upward motion, and realize that you&#39;ve hopelessly internalized the dangerously contagious idea that time is wasted unless work is made to fill it. you shouldn&#39;t think much of this, another intrusive thought that shoots through your brain like an incendiary comet streaking across a peaceful sky—yet this one seems a little different, less distant and much more real. unsettled, you shelve it in the back of your mind and get ready to go to class.

as you&#39;re getting up to leave homeroom, your teacher stops you. a concerned expression on her face, she asks, &quot;you&#39;ve been a little quieter than usual lately. are you okay?&quot;

a seed of panic blossoms in your mind.

you tell her that you&#39;re just tired, that you&#39;ve had a lot of work these past few days and have been getting a bit less sleep than you normally do, but still enough by high school standards. you tell her that you&#39;ve looked at your schedule for the next few days and that you expect this wave to subside in the next day or two, even though you know that more water will invariably rush in to fill its trough, wave after wave crashing down, drowning you. her expression softens a little, and this makes you feel a little better. you go on, telling her that you&#39;ll work it out, as you always have, and asking her not to worry. she seems convinced, but you&#39;re still unsure.

your advisor is an amazing person. she&#39;s always looking out for you, always willing to give you words of advice or lend an understanding ear whenever you most need it, and you feel bad to, well, lie to her like this. but, your mind reassures you, it&#39;s for the better. she&#39;s got a lot on her plate, and you know she&#39;ll worry about you if you tell her what&#39;s going on, because she cares. you convince yourself that this is the right choice, and just hope that she doesn&#39;t press further.

&quot;okay,&quot; she says, still with a worried look on her face. &quot;are you sure? I know you well enough to have a pretty good idea when something&#39;s wrong.&quot;

she does know you pretty well. the panic proliferates anew.

what you really want to ask is how she knew. you thought you were pretty good at hiding it—your entire societal existence relies on the ability to do this and to do it well, and your apparent failure deeply shakes you. but putting that aside, you try to allow yourself to open up just a little, to open up a crevice in your walls. you know you have to control the flow, tightly monitor the volume that leaks out, because the last thing you want is for that crack, that vulnerability, to cascade into a literal and metaphorical breakdown of the barrier, unleashing the dreaded flood in its entirety. you aren&#39;t ready for that, and you certainly wouldn&#39;t want to subject anyone else to the raw force of your mind—after all, you can barely handle it yourself.

sensing your reluctance to elaborate, your advisor pushes, asking if there&#39;s anything specific you want to bring up. you ask her to give you a second to think, and, self-conscious that you&#39;re being watched, like a turtle in headlights, you retreat into your shell to contemplate once more.

you realize that you can&#39;t quite pinpoint the origins of the storm, because just like weather, chaos transcends causality. chaos, the emergent property of systems so unimagibly complex that they become nearly impossible to predict, evolves spontaneously from an infinity of infinitesimal events, fraying threads of timelines traversed and foregone so hopelessly entangled that it&#39;s meaningless to make sense of it all. you think for what seems like ages in the accelerated time stream of your still-racing mind, and you still can&#39;t parse the undecipherable. but it&#39;s been long enough. you emerge from your shell.

&quot;I think it&#39;s just a spike in workload, mostly,&quot; you say. &quot;I&#39;ve had to leave some things undone, had to make choices about what tasks receive my time, and I guess I&#39;m unsettled because I don&#39;t like the idea that something _has_ to give. I&#39;ve always strived to do _everything_, to make time seemingly out of nowhere to take on as much as I can and more and to devote myself fully to all of it. I guess in the past few days I&#39;ve gotten a glimpse of the reality that maybe that isn&#39;t possible anymore, and, well, that fundamentally scares me.&quot;

your advisor pauses for a moment, then responds as thoughtfully as always. &quot;in all the years I&#39;ve known you, one thing I&#39;ve observed is that your biggest regrets arise not from things you&#39;ve done, but things you haven&#39;t. you&#39;re so motivated, so eager, so capable, that there will never be paths you can&#39;t travel—so you try to explore them all. you run day and night, covering more ground every minute than the people around you thought was possible before they met you. but there&#39;s just far too much out there, and even you can&#39;t do everything. so maybe instead of focusing on all the things you&#39;ll never do and all the timelines you&#39;ll never inhabit, concentrate on the fact that in the timelines you&#39;ve chosen, you can make an impact. you don&#39;t have to make your mark on every path—because if you tried, it would consume you. if, by working, by excelling, by existing, you changed the course of the already remarkable number of paths you&#39;ve chosen to walk, that would be worth it.&quot;

tears come to your eyes. this is so painfully true, yet so difficult to accept. you know the feeling inside you, the simultaneously overwhelming and exhilarating heat of your inner furnace burning on high, powering you through your relentless exploration of the unknown. you crave it. you need it to survive. you cannot live without moving—for a life in stasis, even if only momentarily, is a life wasting away, the personification of missed opportunities. 

yet you also know that this fire will destroy you, slowly consuming your oxygen until you choke on your own ambition. but this is your nature, and nature is difficult to change. you tell your advisor that this is something you&#39;ve been struggling with on-and-off for a long time, and she acknowledges that it&#39;ll be difficult, but that she&#39;s happy to talk through it more with you.

you&#39;ve got a lot to think about. you check the time, and you&#39;re ten minutes late to orchestra. suddenly, the regret comes back, stronger than before, as you realize that your advisor is also ten minutes late to her next commitment, because you&#39;ve delayed her with this conversation. you apologize profusely, and she tells you that it&#39;s no problem, that the other teachers will totally understand if she&#39;s a few minutes late to their meeting, but it&#39;s not enough. you consider asking her to write you a note so your orchestra teacher sees that you&#39;re not just late because you felt like it, but she&#39;s already taken enough time for you today, and you&#39;re really not sure if you should ask more of her.

you aren&#39;t sure whether that&#39;s true.

a glance at your watch jolts your mind back into strict school mode, as a gentle reminder pops up for your first class. it&#39;s orchestra, so you [[begin the trek-&gt;orchestra on time]] towards the performing arts building.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="50" name="orchestra on time" tags="" position="2150,925" size="100,100">part of you is glad you didn&#39;t let up, but you also know that she&#39;ll be worried about you, because she probably sensed that you were hiding something. at the same time, another part of you wishes you&#39;d told her, wishes you&#39;d had the courage to be honest. you know yourself too well to think that there&#39;ll ever be a choice you won&#39;t regret at least in part, and you like to think you&#39;ve come to expect that. so you dismiss it, even though the regret continues to gnaw at you in its all-too-familiar rhythm.

you grab your instrument from the cabinet and settle into your seat. you quietly tune it and warm up with the rest of the group, then pull out the many disorganized sheets of paper in your rehearsal folder. you&#39;ve always loved making music, creating soundscapes guided by monochromatic markings on the page. you&#39;ve never been much of one to use your voice, and music lets you express yourself in a continuous spectrum of frequencies, an ocean of waves combining crests in consonant chaos. as the period passes by, you lose track of time and place and self and give your mind entirely to the music as your rushing stream of thoughts merges with the laminar flow of the music, a sort of semi-intentional state of momentary forgetfulness, your stresses drowned out by the sheer force of its waves.

creating music in a group has always been an experience that leaves you with awe and gratitude, and today is no exception. hearing your instrument&#39;s pitches and articulations merge effortlessly with those of your classmates, the threads of sound interlocking and intertwining into the emergent whole we call harmony, you can&#39;t help but contemplate the fact that each of these people playing individually could never come close to creating this wonder that is an ensemble—that each chord and polyphonic line is formed by many people, each playing a part that is nothing without the others.

you play your last piece. it&#39;s a fugue, a musical form where a theme is transformed and passed between different parts of the orchestra as the rest of the ensemble harmonizes around it. and as you take in the intricate dance of melodies and countermelodies, the same idea hits you even harder—this piece falls apart if each player cannot hand off the theme without having complete faith that another instrument across the room will pick it up. this piece falls apart if you only play your own part, because your part means nothing without the support of the rest of the orchestra. you are nothing without the rest of the orchestra.

the fugue comes to a close, each instrument coming in with the theme in succession one final time before arriving at a fitting end. the last note rings throughout the room, and even as it dissipates, you cling onto it, grasp at its already fraying threads, your tethers to one of the few worlds that can overpower the one you inhabit in your mind. but the waves inexorably disappear, leaving you put away your things in silence, the river of thoughts already coursing back through the rapids of your unprepared mind.

what you really want to ask is how she knew. you thought you were pretty good at hiding it—your entire societal existence relies on the ability to do this and to do it well, and your apparent failure deeply shakes you. but putting that aside, you try to allow yourself to open up just a little, to open up a crevice in your walls. you know you have to control the flow, tightly monitor the volume that leaks out, because the last thing you want is for that crack, that vulnerability, to cascade into a literal and metaphorical breakdown of the barrier, unleashing the dreaded flood in its entirety. you aren&#39;t ready for that, and you certainly wouldn&#39;t want to subject anyone else to the raw force of your mind—after all, you can barely handle it yourself.

sensing your reluctance to elaborate, your advisor pushes, asking if there&#39;s anything specific you want to bring up. you ask her to give you a second to think, and, self-conscious that you&#39;re being watched, like a turtle in headlights, you retreat into your shell to contemplate once more.

you realize that you can&#39;t quite pinpoint the origins of the storm, because just like weather, chaos transcends causality. chaos, the emergent property of systems so unimagibly complex that they become nearly impossible to predict, evolves spontaneously from an infinity of infinitesimal events, fraying threads of timelines traversed and foregone so hopelessly entangled that it&#39;s meaningless to make sense of it all. you think for what seems like ages in the accelerated time stream of your still-racing mind, and you still can&#39;t parse the undecipherable. but it&#39;s been long enough. you emerge from your shell.

&quot;I think it&#39;s just a spike in workload, mostly,&quot; you say. &quot;I&#39;ve had to leave some things undone, had to make choices about what tasks receive my time, and I guess I&#39;m unsettled because I don&#39;t like the idea that something _has_ to give. I&#39;ve always strived to do _everything_, to make time seemingly out of nowhere to take on as much as I can and more and to devote myself fully to all of it. I guess in the past few days I&#39;ve gotten a glimpse of the reality that maybe that isn&#39;t possible anymore, and, well, that fundamentally scares me.&quot;

your advisor pauses for a moment, then responds as thoughtfully as always. &quot;in all the years I&#39;ve known you, one thing I&#39;ve observed is that your biggest regrets arise not from things you&#39;ve done, but things you haven&#39;t. you&#39;re so motivated, so eager, so capable, that there will never be paths you can&#39;t travel—so you try to explore them all. you run day and night, covering more ground every minute than the people around you thought was possible before they met you. but there&#39;s just far too much out there, and even you can&#39;t do everything. so maybe instead of focusing on all the things you&#39;ll never do and all the timelines you&#39;ll never inhabit, concentrate on the fact that in the timelines you&#39;ve chosen, you can make an impact. you don&#39;t have to make your mark on every path—because if you tried, it would consume you. if, by working, by excelling, by existing, you changed the course of the already remarkable number of paths you&#39;ve chosen to walk, that would be worth it.&quot;

tears come to your eyes. this is so painfully true, yet so difficult to accept. you know the feeling inside you, the simultaneously overwhelming and exhilarating heat of your inner furnace burning on high, powering you through your relentless exploration of the unknown. you crave it. you need it to survive. you cannot live without moving—for a life in stasis, even if only momentarily, is a life wasting away, the personification of missed opportunities. 

yet you also know that this fire will destroy you, slowly consuming your oxygen until you choke on your own ambition. but this is your nature, and nature is difficult to change. you tell your advisor that this is something you&#39;ve been struggling with on-and-off for a long time, and she acknowledges that it&#39;ll be difficult, but that she&#39;s happy to talk through it more with you.

you&#39;ve got a lot to think about. you check the time, and you&#39;re ten minutes late to orchestra. suddenly, the regret comes back, stronger than before, as you realize that your advisor is also ten minutes late to her next commitment, because you&#39;ve delayed her with this conversation. you apologize profusely, and she tells you that it&#39;s no problem, that the other teachers will totally understand if she&#39;s a few minutes late to their meeting, but it&#39;s not enough. you consider asking her to write you a note so your orchestra teacher sees that you&#39;re not just late because you felt like it, but she&#39;s already taken enough time for you today, and you&#39;re really not sure if you should ask more of her.

you timidly ask your teacher to write a note you can take to orchestra, all the while continuing to apologize. she does so gladly, and as she sits down again and pulls out a sticky note, you just feel more guilty for making her even more late just so you can have one less lateness in the attendance system and one less awkward conversation with your teacher. but the note is already being written. and then it is given to you, and it is carried by your hurried legs out of the room, as you and your teacher part ways. you accelerate, racing down the stairs, racing out of the main building, racing across campus and through the hallways of the performing arts building, racing to try and [[outrun your thoughts-&gt;orchestra late]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="53" name="orchestra late" tags="" position="2150,1075" size="100,100">[if orchestraLateNote === &quot;yes&quot;]
you burst into the orchestra room, breathless. they&#39;re already almost done with the warm-up exercises, so you quietly get your instrument out and begin preparing to play until they&#39;re done. you then timidly walk up to the teacher and give him the note, and you apologize for being late. he says that it&#39;s no problem, glances at the note, and tucks it away. you thought there would be more, but now you&#39;re glad you got the note, even though it did cost your teacher a few minutes. now, you feel like it was worth it, and then feel guilty just the same for approving of your own suboptimal choice. but—was there an optimal choice?

your teacher calls everyone back to their seats and calls up the first group to present. thankfully, it&#39;s not you, so you settle down and try to clear your headspace enough to listen and process the content. you&#39;re not sure whether you actually succeed, but the presentation starts anyway.

[[you await your turn.-&gt;bio class presentation]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="55" name="bio class presentation" tags="" position="2400,1000" size="100,100">you would prefer that this presentation be something you forget. you&#39;d prefer that this moment blur in your memory, because you didn&#39;t do enough to get here. you know that if you look back on this presentation, all you&#39;ll do is reactivate the wave of regret that washes over you now as you walk up to the front of the room with your group. 

one person here is not like the others, you think. one person here hasn&#39;t done their fair share. when the class looks at this presentation, when they see your name along with the others on the title slide, they&#39;ll implicitly assume that you all split the work equally. and they&#39;ll be wrong.

you wish you could make your name smaller. maybe then it&#39;d be accurate.

you try not to make eye contact with your groupmates as you go through the presentation. you know they aren&#39;t mad at you, but you can&#39;t let yourself off the hook that easily. you just tell yourself to focus and do the best you can on the slides, because that&#39;s the best you can do now. 

you can&#39;t change the past, as hard as you try, so you just move forward faster and faster. maybe if you go fast enough, faster than light, you could rewrite some of the timeline, rewind it and fix your mistakes. you know physics deems this impossible, but since when has impossibility stopped you from trying?

the presentation is over. you were the last group, so your teacher lets your class go, even though it&#39;s a few minutes early. you gather your things and walk out of the room. the hallways are empty. you don&#39;t have to go to math for another forty minutes, but you still find yourself running. you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re running from, or what you&#39;re running to. you run [[faster-&gt;hallway after bio]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="56" name="hallway after bio" tags="" position="1400,1425" size="100,100">most classes won&#39;t let out for another few minutes, so the hallway outside the bio classroom is fairly empty. you run down the length of the corridor, your pace a stark contrast to its stationary walls. taking a few turns a bit faster than you probably should and jumping down a flight of stairs, you find your way to the main atrium. moving to the side of the wide hallway, you throw open your bag and pull out a small planner, the physical and notably less forgetful manifestation of the endless to-do list you keep in your brain. tonight will somehow be even worse than yesterday: history and english reading, a computer science problem set, and more math homework. one nearly sleepless night has weakened your shell, and dread is already seeping through the cracks, threatening to crystallize in the biting cold of another interminable night and widen the fissures. 

you put your planner away, because some foolish part of you believes that casting your work out of your mind will erase it from your to-do list. but that same part of you is foolish enough to believe that you can even banish the work from your mind. nature abhors a vacuum. you cannot purge your mind of work. what are you without work? what are you without constant neural activity, constant forward movement, constant progress towards the amorphous end of the tunnel? what would you do without the omnipresent motion blur that smudges your surroundings into a collage of collateral corollaries, channeling your focus towards the challenges ahead?

you look up. second period is over, and your friends are beginning to congregate in the hallway. a few of them see you on the floor, your wide open bag and planner scattered around you, and walk over to the side of the hallway. they tell you that there&#39;s a new puzzle in the library, and ask you if you want to go work on it with them. you love doing puzzles, and you haven&#39;t seen your friends all day. but you feel the gravity of assignments left undone pulling you away. you have to make a decision. you already see them shrinking back as they watch your facial expression change. you don&#39;t have much time left if you want to catch them before they go.

you stuff your things into your bag and get up to go with your friends. as you&#39;re walking up the stairs to the library, your mind is already berating you for once again deprioritizing your work. your worn-out psyche wants nothing more right now than to let up for a minute, wind down and spend some time with people you love doing this puzzle together, but you&#39;re also scared of what this choice will do for you down the road. you&#39;re scared of tonight, of the even more insane amount of work you&#39;ll have to do because you didn&#39;t start it now. and you&#39;re scared of tomorrow, of having to make even more difficult choices than you did today about who to forgo, who to let down, who to disappoint.

without thinking about it, you let your legs carry you to the library. your eyes are looking ahead of you, but you don&#39;t see the hallway or the stairwell or the door. you see the timeline you&#39;re permanently locked out of, the timeline where you said no, went and found an isolated alcove, and got to work. you watch as the timeline drifts further and further away, a reality diverging ever further away from your reach. 

this is no different than all the others, yet another path not traveled. and you can&#39;t help but realize that if you were on that path, you would be just the same, gazing wistfully at a timeline where you&#39;re enjoying a fleeting moment of time with friends, helpless as that universe rapidly shrinks into the horizon. this doesn&#39;t make the guilt any easier to shake off, though, because the entire force of your upbringing rebels against this choice, the conscious choice to do something supposedly unproductive. 

you feel like you&#39;ve let somebody down, but you&#39;re not sure whom.

you and your friends get to the library, put your stuff down, and get started on the puzzle. it&#39;s a picture of new york city, a snapshot of a glass and concrete maze, streets and avenues extending parallel and perpendicular into the distance. people bustle about like excited particles in chaotic motion, trying to keep up with the new york pace lest they be swept away in the winds that sweep the cavernous corridors of its urban canyons. hands swarm across the table, finding halves of street signs and building windows, lane markers and traffic lights, piecing together fragments of thousands of lives and the environment that brings them into contact. and while all of your hands are whirring about, you talk: catching up about your day, lamenting about the shared feeling that you&#39;re overworked and in need of rest, joking about how you should probably be doing something else. these are the moments you crave, moments of respite from the whirlwinds, moments that remind you that there are other people weathering this storm. 

your legs ache from months of running, running so fast that the sheer adrenaline numbed the pain. you feel the fatigue acutely now, and you know it&#39;ll be so much harder to get going again. but despite that, and despite the thunderclouds of tonight&#39;s thousand tasks looming large on the horizon, despite the storm surges of regret welling up and crashing down, you&#39;re glad you spent this time with your friends. you tell yourself that this wasn&#39;t a waste of time, that taking a break is healthy for you, but you were always hard to convince.

whenever you&#39;re in the depths of a work session, one dreaded thought inevitably crops up in your mind. _why?_ why are you doing this? why are you taking so many classes, working two internships, leading a club? you like all of these things—well, most of them—so why can&#39;t you find the motivation to work on them with your best effort? people always told you that if you love what you do, it won&#39;t feel like work—so do you really love all your activities? can you really love your activities, if they make you feel like this?

in a year, your classes, the grade you got on yesterday&#39;s homework assignment, the meeting you were ten minutes late to, won&#39;t mean anything. in a year, all the minutiae will be lost to the gravity well of time, and what&#39;ll be left? your friends are the only continuity in this constantly contorting cosmos, and you&#39;re happy that you took these scarce minutes to be with them, to talk with them, to hug them, to do a puzzle for nothing but its own sake.

or are you?

you were always hard to convince.

class time is approaching. you hug your friends one last time, then gather your things. you&#39;ve spent too long here. time is running out. you&#39;re running out. you dash out of the library at frantic speed, the timeline collapsing behind you, and run to math. you sprint, hoping that you can outrun the primordial guilt that stubbornly refuses to go away.

you tell your friends that you should probably do some work and that they should go without you. stuffing your things into your bag, you get up. your mind wants to run away, to distance yourself from the possibility that you could have gone to the library, because maybe if you get far enough away, you could convince yourself that you couldn&#39;t have gone anyway. maybe that would make it sting a bit less.

but you can&#39;t run. all your energy, all your spirit, is with your friends in the library. so, your head down, you walk. walk slowly, towards the narrow hallway by the base of the stairwell, towards the corner nook you routinely inhabit, towards the all-too-familiar site of countless work sessions tainted by missed opportunities. as you mentally enumerate your tasks and open your bag, you feel an abstract sense of pride, a sense of satisfaction in the fact that you chose the responsible route, the forward-looking route, the correct route. it feels out of place, like someone planted the feeling in your mind, its sinister seedling an invasive species taking root and proliferating beyond your control. but, as so many foreign feelings do, it has swiftly become a naturalized citizen of your brain, given full privileges to exert its influence. 

so even though you&#39;re sitting alone, about to start your work, you feel... good? you&#39;re not sure. it feels good to be productive, but you&#39;re not sure how productive you will be, because another part of you, a part you&#39;re inclined to trust more, whispers with a quiet but insistent voice that the timeline you&#39;ve taken is neither responsible nor forward-looking, and certainly not correct.

you pull out your history textbook. there are only a few pages you&#39;ve got to read for tomorrow, and if you focus, you can get this done. you need to get this done. if you don&#39;t, will this have been worth it? and worse, will this have been worth it even if you do?

you start reading. your eyes are looking at the paper in front of you, but you don&#39;t see the words or the sentences or the ideas it contains. you see the timeline you&#39;re permanently locked out of, the timeline where you said yes, went to the library and worked on the new puzzle, your hands whirring about the table as you catch up with your friends. stationary, on the floor in your corner, you watch as the timeline drifts further and further away, a reality diverging ever further away from your reach. 

this is no different than all the others, yet another path not traveled. and you can&#39;t help but realize that if you were on that path, you would be just the same, gazing regretfully at a timeline where you&#39;re getting some work done and making your night easier, helpless as that universe rapidly shrinks into the horizon. this doesn&#39;t make the guilt any easier to shake off, though, because the entire force of your humanity rebels against this choice, the conscious choice to give up an opportunity to be with people you love for a little while amidst what has already been an overwhelming day.

you feel like you&#39;ve let somebody down, but you&#39;re not sure whom.

your legs ache from months of running, running so fast that the sheer adrenaline numbed the pain. you drown the fatigue in a deluge of work, knowing that if you ever close the floodgates, the pain will return in full force. but despite that, and despite the promise of hugs shared with friends over a rapidly progressing puzzle just out of your reach, despite the storm surges of regret welling up and crashing down, you tell yourself that even if this wasn&#39;t a good decision, it wasn&#39;t a bad one either. but you were always hard to convince.

or are you?

you were always hard to convince.

class time is approaching. you muscle through a decent bit of the reading, then abruptly stop and gather your things. you&#39;ve spent too long here. time is running out. you&#39;re running out. you get up and tear down the hallway at frantic speed, the timeline collapsing behind you, and run to math. you sprint, hoping that you can outrun the primordial guilt that stubbornly refuses to go away.

you reach the math room, right on time. out of breath, you [[walk in-&gt;math]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="59" name="math" tags="" position="1650,1425" size="100,100">[if morningMath === &quot;done&quot;]
as you sit down in your seat, the spectral image of yet another timeline haunts your mind&#39;s eye. you invisibly shudder as you realize that if you had made different choices this morning, if you had prioritized other work instead, if you had slept more yesterday, you would have ended up here with an incomplete problem set, empty-handed and helpless in the face of the immutability of time. even though you know that there&#39;s no point dwelling on the nonexistent, it unsettles you profoundly nonetheless.

[if morningMath === &quot;mostly done&quot;]
as you sit down in your seat, you try to avoid making eye contact with your teacher, the unfinished problem set weighing down your bag. a wave of realization hits you, as it once again dawns on you that this is the first time you&#39;ve shirked your math homework in years. this is not the first time you&#39;re having this thought, but it hits profoundly nonetheless.

[if morningMath === &quot;none&quot;]
as you sit down in your seat, you try to avoid making eye contact with your teacher, the neglected problem set an impossibly heavy mass burning a hole in your bag. a wave of realization hits you, as it once again dawns on you that this is the first time you&#39;ve skipped your math homework in years. this is not the first time you&#39;re having this thought, but it hits profoundly nonetheless.

[continue]
your teacher begins class by going over the homework. you normally tend to be rather quiet, but today you&#39;re even quieter than usual. compounding like uniform-density laminae stacking onto each other, the cumulative weight of the day&#39;s events gravitationally tugs on you, an ominous sensation you can&#39;t quite shake. you pay attention in class, as you always have, as your teacher discusses surface integration; and you solve the practice problems robotically, your hand tracing out the increasingly ornate notational symbols with uncharacteristically impersonal autonomy. 

everyone around you knows you love math. many—including yourself—go so far as to call you a math kid. but you&#39;re not sure if you&#39;re living up to that distinction now—and thinking about it, you&#39;re not sure if you ever did. spiraling downward into the abyss of history, you find yourself wondering whether you ever truly _enjoyed_ math, whether you ever did it for anything besides the hollow joy of just doing something that came easily to you. you find yourself wondering whether you enjoy _anything_, because you&#39;re just doing it all in a painfully abstract chase for the shining bastion of college. you find yourself wondering what it even means to _enjoy_—and wondering whether that pure notion of joy and the concrete, pragmatic exigencies of the school system are mutually exclusive.

but they aren&#39;t. you know they aren&#39;t. you&#39;ve enjoyed nearly every math test, even as your heart beats faster and time ticks down and even though the result will be a cold hard grade in your teacher&#39;s gradebook. you&#39;ve enjoyed your research papers, even as you recall work sessions at your desk in untold hours of the morning, facing hundreds of tabs spanning uncontrollably expanding webs of sources, unable to find the words you need to capture the fractal intricacies of history or the elusive fabrics of literature and society. you&#39;ve enjoyed your science labs, chasing the irreplaceable sense of wonder that arises when the experiment falls into place and you watch as the results cohere in your data table, even despite the excruciating hours of preparing and retrying and editing and checking the lab report to squeeze the last few points out of the rubric. you have always found enjoyment in these things, tasks that could just as easily be undertaken for the sole purpose of obtaining a grade—because you really do love learning. but to love takes effort, and sometimes, you just can&#39;t muster the effort. and that&#39;s fine. you just have to make sure that, in those times, when the storm clouds set in and obscure the sky, you don&#39;t lose sight of the horizons that captivated you in the first place.

encouraged by this imperative, you finish the rest of the practice problems. they&#39;re clever, very clever, and you have to wrestle with the last one for a while, but two minutes before the end of class, you finally crack it. looking back at your solution, you&#39;re reminded why you love math: the freedom, the versatility, the variety of thought, the countless crossing paths you can take, each leading to the same solution in its own individual way, each the product of an uncountable infinity of choices. you&#39;ve encountered one more uniform-density lamina, but this one doesn&#39;t feel heavy at all.

class ends, and people start leaving the room. you really want to stay here with your friends for a little while, decompress, chat, do nothing, but you have to go to a meeting. you&#39;ve known forever that this is happening—it&#39;s a weekly meeting—but you dread it nonetheless. responsibility at once humbles and scares you, and even though you&#39;ve prepared everything you need, you still feel apprehensive about speaking to a team of people much older and more experienced than you, still feel convinced they&#39;ll find holes in your knowledge, still feel inadequate for the job they&#39;ve trusted you to do. you wonder whether you&#39;ll ever outrun that feeling, whether you&#39;ll ever be able to catch up to the shadow of yourself that you see reflected in others&#39; eyes. you don&#39;t know if you can, but it doesn&#39;t stop you from trying.

you say bye to your friends. they know where you have to go. they wish you good luck, and you all share rushed hugs before you dash out of the room. then, as always, you run. run, hoping to catch up to an accelerating ideal of success. run, so you can just maybe leave behind the inadequacy that always seems to keep pace with you no matter how fast you go. once again, just like in the hallway before, you&#39;re not quite sure where you&#39;re going. of course, this doesn&#39;t stop you—it never has. you run [[faster-&gt;hallway before lunch meeting]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="60" name="hallway before lunch meeting" tags="" position="1775,1425" size="100,100">tearing through the hallways, you frantically search for a room to take your meeting from. you now regret the single minute you spent with your friends before vanishing from the math room—and simultaneously recognize the absurdity of doing so, the absurdity of this reality where every second is occupied, every moment mercilessly optimized away. finally, passing people milling around the halls about to go to lunch, you spot an empty room. as you&#39;re about to duck inside, one of the math teachers, whom you know pretty well, calls to you. you briefly consider just going into the room—you&#39;d certainly have plausible deniability if you were to claim you didn&#39;t see her—but you don&#39;t. 

she asks you whether you&#39;d be available in a half hour to cover a middle school math tutoring session. you run the sessions on some days and weren&#39;t scheduled to do it today, but the person who ordinarily covers today is out sick, so your teacher wants you to do it. your meeting will be over in a half hour, so you could go teach the middle schoolers, but if you did, you&#39;d be there until the end of lunch, and you&#39;d have no time to eat. you&#39;ve got to make this decision quickly, because you&#39;re already getting late for your meeting.

you join the meeting, and thankfully, none of the others are here yet — they&#39;re probably all caught up in another call. in the brief moment of pause, you think about the choice you just made, a choice that will have you skip lunch to do something you deeply enjoy doing, just at a slightly inconvenient time. you tell yourself that this choice was justified, because if you had said no, the middle schoolers could show up to the scheduled tutoring session and find no one. sure, there was the possibility that someone else could have done it, but only a few other people helped with the tutoring in the first place, and you didn&#39;t want to risk leaving the middle schoolers empty-handed. at the same time, some part of your mind berates you for sacrificing your nourishment so readily, because who are you to place work above your own health? you tell yourself it&#39;s just this once, but you have the curse of a good memory, and you know that this is far from the first time and will be far from the last. yet you feel like this was inevitable, part and parcel of this precious package called responsibility that has proven at once immensely rewarding and profoundly taxing.

and in the back of your mind, you wonder whether this was really a choice at all.

these thoughts are pushed to the side by the sound of people joining the call. pushing down the encroaching impostor syndrome, you update the team on your recent work and planned next steps, and a few minutes of discussion ensue. you&#39;ve become pretty adept at masking your fear, and you hope it doesn&#39;t show through—but then again, the events of the morning have not been a good sign for your masking abilities. 

regardless, you power through the meeting. the team seems happy enough with your work, and they luckily didn&#39;t throw you any particularly tough questions today, so you finish a few minutes early, with just enough time to comfortably walk to the middle school for the tutoring session.

nevertheless, [[you run-&gt;tutoring session]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="62" name="lunch meeting no tutoring" tags="" position="1900,1500" size="100,100">[if advisorChat]

you join the meeting, and thankfully, none of the others are here yet — they&#39;re probably all caught up in another call. in the brief moment of pause, you think about the choice you just made, a choice that will have you forgo something you deeply enjoy doing and that is valuable to other people in order to leave yourself time for lunch. you tell yourself that this choice was justified, because taking care of yourself is important, or so people tell you, and you&#39;ve been trying to believe that more. you&#39;ve been pretty bad about tending to your own needs in the past, and it&#39;s something you&#39;re improving on—and this is a step in that direction. at the same time, some part of your mind berates you for shirking your duties so readily, because who are you to place a single day&#39;s lunch over a program that you&#39;ve committed to and that people depend on? 

you tell yourself that you&#39;ll make sure to avoid overscheduling your lunch break in the future, but you have the curse of a good memory, and you know that this is far from the first time and will be far from the last. things always come up, and by your nature, you will endeavor to occupy every moment, every second. you can get behind the choice you&#39;ve made, but you don&#39;t like that you had to make a choice—yet you feel like this was inevitable, part and parcel of this precious package called responsibility that has proven at once immensely rewarding and profoundly taxing.

regardless, you power through the meeting. the team seems happy enough with your work, and they luckily didn&#39;t throw you any particularly tough questions today, so you finish a few minutes early. almost reflexively, you open your email and pull down to refresh. you see an email from your math teacher, sent three minutes ago. even as you open it, the message reads itself in your mind, confirming your apprehensions. she says that she couldn&#39;t find anyone else, and asks one last time if you would be willing to cover.

if you say no, the middle schoolers will end up empty-handed, and it&#39;ll be your fault. you know that the choice would be defensible, because eating is a core human necessity, but that doesn&#39;t diminish the fact that it would be you pulling the lever, you allowing the trolley to run forth on its track. you&#39;re overdramatizing this, you admonish yourself. this is a single session of the program, which runs every single day. they could just come back tomorrow, right? but something doesn&#39;t sit right with you. yes, they could, but that isn&#39;t the point, is it? this is just a single meal you&#39;re skipping, and it&#39;s not like you won&#39;t eat later tonight, right?

sensing choice paralysis, your autonomous mind takes over. you furiously type out a response, telling your teacher that you&#39;ll be there. you remember that you told her you had to get lunch after this, and you know she&#39;ll deduce that you&#39;d have to skip lunch to do this. so, not even fully in control of your mind, you lie to her, telling her you&#39;ll get lunch afterwards, no big deal, because you have a free next period.

you don&#39;t.

you briefly look over the email, then hit send. your mind doesn&#39;t register what you&#39;ve just done, only that you have to get to the middle school, and fast. you shove your things into your bag and get up, realizing that after all, even after you found the courage to take the difficult step of saying no, you&#39;re still doing this. such, you suppose, is the double-edged sword of responsibility.

and, in the back of your mind, you wonder whether this was really a choice at all.

you don&#39;t know. but you&#39;re late now. so [[you run-&gt;tutoring session]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="63" name="tutoring session" tags="" position="2025,1425" size="100,100">you make it to the middle school on time. a few people are already there, and when you walk in, they&#39;re surprised to see you, since you usually don&#39;t come on this day. you all know the drill, though, so you put your things down, erase the board, and grab some markers. while you&#39;re waiting for the middle schoolers to pull out their notebooks and get their questions ready, you wonder again what would have happened if no one covered this session. skipping lunch certainly wasn&#39;t ideal, but you&#39;re glad you&#39;re here for this.

the middle schoolers ask some good questions, and you give probably-slightly-too-long answers that go in probably a bit more depth than needed. amid the strokes of the marker on the whiteboard punctuated by murmurs of confusion and then understanding from the students, you forget that your only window for lunch has come and will soon be gone—you&#39;re having fun, teaching the math you so love, spinning the threads of its abstract conceptual fabric into a quilt of numbers and symbols and relationships. after all, what is math but the study of relationships, of connections between seemingly disparate entities that share deeper common ground beneath their surface-level differences? you have the threads, and your job is to show the middle schoolers how to create a tapestry that interweaves them into a coherent whole.

as the period wraps up, you erase the board for a final time, then say goodbye to the students. you tell them to email you with any questions that might come up later—you&#39;re always good about responding. and then you leave, beginning the journey back to the other building for english. you could run, but you&#39;ve got a few minutes, and besides, you&#39;re feeling a bit low on energy. so this time, [[you walk-&gt;hallway before english]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="64" name="hallway before english" tags="" position="2150,1425" size="100,100">[if morningEnglish === &quot;none&quot;]

you know this paper will mercilessly consume any and all time you put into it. these meticulously crafted words will defy the laws of physics, bending time and space to their will. but it&#39;s not the paper&#39;s fault. it&#39;s you. you will never settle. you will never reach cruising altitude, always climbing further and further, until—what? you escape the gravitational pull of a planet that could never contain you, throwing yourself into an interplanetary void where &quot;up&quot; loses its meaning, and where do you climb then?

by all reasonable measures, this paper is good already. you worked on it for many, many hours—almost certainly more than you should have. honestly, that was likely a significant contributor to the overflow of work you faced this morning. but, still, you can&#39;t just accept that it&#39;s finished. this isn&#39;t like math—there&#39;s no tidy argument, no proof in finitely many steps. this problem is undecidable, forever doomed never to be true or false, a glaring mark of the incompleteness of the rigid system that you have tried to fit to your world. you know this, and yet you continue to search for a proof, continue to toil away at the problem, attacking it from all known angles and finding unknown ones when you&#39;ve exhausted them all. you know it&#39;ll never be perfect, but you can never let that truth allow you to stop searching for perfection. after all, you were always hard to convince.

I guess I just need to get it in my head that getting arbitrarily close to perfection will take a disproportionate amount of time, time that I probably want to allocate elsewhere. But the problem is, I still believe that she&#39;d notice if I put in less effort—if only because she&#39;s come to expect from me a level of quality I can only produce if I put in lots of work.&quot;-&gt;english dialogue 3-1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="72" name="english dialogue 3-2" tags="" position="2650,1500" size="100,100">&quot;with all due respect,&quot; your friend immediately snaps back, &quot;how do you ever submit anything?&quot;

you look at them blankly. then it dawns on you what exactly they&#39;re saying.

they continue. &quot;how does your draconian conscience let you hand in anything? I&#39;ve known you long enough to know that you exceedingly rarely, if ever, manage to produce work you&#39;re truly proud of. I can only recall two such times in the six years I&#39;ve known you—so what gives?&quot;

you take a deep breath, the restless ghosts of every suboptimally submitted assignment surrounding you, occupying every last corner of your mind&#39;s eye. &quot;you don&#39;t see it because I&#39;m pretty good at hiding it, but every single time I hand in an assignment, I have to suppress the deafening voices in my head telling me it&#39;s not good enough. every single time I hit submit, I have to accept the fact that it&#39;s less than my best, and even though I&#39;ve had to do this on probably thousands of occasions, it still stings every time.&quot;

your friend sees the look on your face. &quot;okay, I understand that. I admire your commitment to diligence for diligence&#39;s sake, and I now see why you take so long to craft your essays, but at the same time, I can&#39;t help but warn you that this might get unsustainable very quickly. I can see that it&#39;s already taken a toll on you, and it&#39;s only going to compound as more and larger assignments come and go.&quot;

you appreciate your friend&#39;s concern, even though you unfortunately know from years of experience that their suggestions are futile. &quot;I&#39;ve been wrestling with this for years now, and I don&#39;t think I can ever fully get rid of it. so I&#39;ve embraced the good parts—the uncompromising attitude towards the quality of my work, the motivation it gives me, the consistency—and built my life around the rest. thank you for caring, though—and rest assured that I&#39;ll keep trying to shift my standards in the right direction.&quot;

and with that, your teacher walks into the room. class started a few minutes ago, but thankfully, your conversation didn&#39;t get cut off. you give your friend a quick hug and then sit down at your desk and get out your laptop. you open it, navigate to your class&#39;s assignment page, and hit submit on your essay. another ghost joins the fray, but in the sea of specters that already clouds your vision, this one doesn&#39;t make much of a difference.

class proceeds in customary fashion, discussion punctuated by occasional periods of pensive silence that lingers heavy in the air. you know everyone in the class and trust them, so you&#39;re comfortable being vulnerable, and as you always do, you give yourself fully to the conversation. time still rushes by, but its waters are calmer now. you keep your head up, and breathe fast. you&#39;ve learned not to take the air for granted.

class ends. you say goodbye to your friends and leave the room. this was your last class, so the school day is over. you don&#39;t know what to do next, but your mind insists that you must do something. decisions are hard, so you let go, and let the time stream carry you [[forward-&gt;after english]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="73" name="english dialogue 3-1" tags="" position="2650,1350" size="100,100">&quot;that&#39;s fair,&quot; your friend concedes. &quot;so you&#39;ve kind of dug your own grave, by setting the bar astronomically high not only from your own perspective but also from hers. I guess she sees the end product, but not the amount of work that goes into it, so without any evidence to the contrary, she must think this is just what you produce in a normal amount of time.&quot;

&quot;probably,&quot; you respond. the reality your friend is spelling out is one you&#39;ve begrudgingly accepted already, the reality that your reputation may perpetually precede you, blowing your actual ability far out of proportion and locking you into an unsustainable cycle of overwork to try and meet sky-high expectations. you&#39;ve never wanted to disappoint, and even if you were somehow able to make yourself satisfied with half-finished work, the difference in effort would certainly show.

trying to offer a way forward, your friend speculates, &quot;I know it might be hard to just reset her expectations now, but honestly, I think the revision process has very diminishing returns, so there&#39;s a good chance you could save a substantial amount of time without taking much of a hit in quality at all.&quot;

&gt; [[&quot;maybe I could, but even putting our teacher&#39;s opinions aside, the problem is still me.

the school day is over, and you have more than two hours to wait before your bus comes to take you back home. you always dread these afternoons, drawn-out hours usually spent alone in the now-deserted library, the silently sinking sun shining its waning rays through the endless panels of glass windows. most of your friends leave earlier than you do, leaving you sitting there, facing an inexorably darkening world. on these days, you&#39;ve learned to try and keep your eyes focused on your work, but despite your best efforts, the light streams through the library&#39;s glass windows, slowly fading away then glowing in electrifying hues before finally dimming into the muted monochrome of twilight. your motivation will sink with the sun, absorbed by the colors that herald its departure, leaving nothing but an inhumanly long list of tasks and the prospect of a long night ahead. your desk lamp will try to illuminate your room, but you know better than to think it could ever replace the star whose absence gives it purpose. and your mind will try to fill the void with light of its own, scintillating flashes of thoughts and memories that you&#39;d rather stay in the dark, and you&#39;ll be powerless to stop its rays from infinitely reflecting off of the walls of your room, blinding in their compounded intensity, because unlike time, you are helpless in the face of the laws of physics.

today is another one of those days. the sun will set long before you have to leave, and you can already see it falling, pulled by gravity towards the distant horizon. you have _so_ much work to do, and even though much of it is material you enjoy engaging with, you just can&#39;t muster that same joy now. school has never been a chore for you, the homework never just another meaningless item to muscle through and check off the list, but now, in this moment, you&#39;re not so sure that the tasks ahead of you seem like anything more than barriers to be whittled down, progress bars to painstakingly push to completion. and this scares you, because the only reason you&#39;ve been able to handle such crazy workloads is that, well, you&#39;ve never thought of it as just _work_. and, now, when you have so much going on, if school turns into a chore—

how will you do it?

this scares you.

but there&#39;s no time to be scared. the waters rush by, and even though you shudder at the thought of jumping in, you throw yourself into the current, because you have no other option.

you think about what happened in math earlier today. working on hard problems, and eventually cracking them, has always been your favorite aspect of the subject, and you so badly want to enjoy math, because you know that you can. it might be a better idea to work on the history reading or your CS homework—after all, you know from experience that your ability to code diminishes as the night gets later, but just as swiftly as it swooped in, logic takes a backseat. your mind&#39;s gears lock into place.

these problems are difficult, much harder than the last set. but you have a good handle on the material, so you attack them the same way you always do—by picking up the problems and turning them around, examing their multifaceted surfaces from many angles until that elusive phenomenon called insight takes root in your mind. the process takes a while, but one by one, the problems fall, fortresses toppled not by a battering ram but by the concerted effort of countless vines of ivy snaking up their walls and dismantling their internals. and, you realize, you&#39;re enjoying it. thoroughly.

a gentle alarm on your phone goes off. it&#39;s been a half hour, and this means you should probably move onto something else, especially since this math homework isn&#39;t even due tomorrow. even though you&#39;re enjoying this, you know that you have to put it away—you should really get to history and computer science, or at least one of them, in the time you have.

yet another choice presents itself to you. history reading or CS problem set? you know the reading will be dense and likely tiring, and you don&#39;t do well coding while tired, but honestly, you don&#39;t think the problem set could be that difficult, and you&#39;d rather get the harder work out of the way first. what to do?

just out of curiosity, you tell yourself, you open your laptop and glance at the problem set.

the neatly monospaced text catches your eye. the problems intrigue you—they&#39;re achievable, but not at all trivial. if you could just throw yourself into them for a little bit, just a half hour, you could probably finish them, you think.

you know this feeling. the possibility of history reading drifts away like sheets of loose-leaf in the wind, leaving you staring at your computer, the gears of your mind once again locking into place.

this really isn&#39;t a choice after all.

slowly walking down the stairs, your legs learning to move again after almost an hour sitting still, you reflect on the afternoon so far. you feel like your choices have been taken from you, like you&#39;ve just been living a predetermined sequence of events. and, honestly, it&#39;s been fairly productive for you—less time spent wasted making decisions means more time working. but are those moments of choice, those moments staring at a diverging path trying to see what lies at both ends, really wasted? the determinism of having a single choice can be liberating in its own way, but decisions, however painful they may be, are the only way you can push and pull the levers of your timeline, modulate the streams that will otherwise bring you along for their hopelessly unpredictable ride.

every minute you&#39;ve spent making a choice, you like to think, is a minute invested in a more favorable timeline; but today has shown you the slightest bit of evidence to the contrary, that maybe, counterintuitively, decisions are needlessly restrictive—because maybe you could be more efficient if a small bit of your mind wasn&#39;t torn away at every junction by the inexorable pull of the paths you didn&#39;t take.

you think about this morning. you had just about the same number of options, but back then, the choices didn&#39;t make themselves. is it so, then, however paradoxically, that a more rational thought process this time around led to less decision-making? or did you merely imagine yourself an illusion of a logical conclusion, avoiding a situation like this morning&#39;s by simply failing to consider all but one of a larger set of forking paths out of misguided conviction? 

you don&#39;t know, and you don&#39;t want to think about it. all that matters is that you&#39;re getting work done, right?

the water fountain is just around the corner. you&#39;ve walked this exact path a thousand times, on a thousand long afternoons where your thirst gets the better of you, but for some reason the distance seemed longer than usual today. you pick up your pace and reach it in another minute, and as you&#39;re refilling your water, you hear familiar voices in the lounge at the end of the hallway—it seems like a few of your friends are still at school.

it works, to a degree. you&#39;re able to claw your way through this problem after what is almost definitely far too much time wrestling with it, and thankfully, the rest of the problems are not too bad. coding has always appealed to you for its cold logic, its impersonality, that it manages to juxtapose with applications to very personal problems—it satisfies both halves of you, the one that delights in rigidity and rigor helped along by painstakingly uncovered gems of insight as well as the one that craves meaning and purpose in the dangerously abstract worlds it nonetheless chooses to explore. but here, now, tunnel-visioning your way through a problem set that has collapsed from a forest trail network ripe for hiking to a claustrophobic one-way corridor to squeeze through, you can see neither the little details you so appreciate nor the larger context you&#39;re constantly searching for. just as it did with math, though, you know it&#39;ll return with time, when you&#39;re in a better frame of mind. you hope.

the group is playing _Pandemic_. this is one of your favorite board games, bringing in elements of resource management, risk-and-reward dynamics, balancing of short-term and long-term planning, and of course, difficult decisions that have ramifications far beyond their immediate consequences. they&#39;re in the middle of a game, so you sit with one of your friends and watch as outbreaks spread and gradually become contained, virulent threads of proto-disaster worming their way across a miniaturized world constantly teetering on the brink of collapse. they&#39;re so close to finishing, with just one more of the four diseases to &quot;cure&quot; in order to win—but just like that, they draw an epidemic card, triggering an outbreak that proves to be the final straw. disease spreads uncontrollably across the board, every single one of their decisions acting in concert to orchestrate their downfall. the minor infection cluster they chose not to wipe out—it was too small to worry about at the time—facilitated the rapid spread of the outbreak; the special action card they wished they&#39;d used earlier stared at them, inert and lifeless on the table, being saved for a later that would never come; the network of research centers (locations on the board that characters must be at in order to cure a disease), malformed because of their uncoordinated and far-from-prescient placements, popped out in regrettable sparsity from an otherwise crowded board. the many strands of the game&#39;s past had converged on them.

as the group begins setting up for a new round, you talk with your friends, asking them how their days were and sharing little snippets or interesting experiences you&#39;d had. you hear about piles of work, dreaded assessments, tiredness, and fatigue, but also about insightful conversations with teachers, moments of rest with friends, and unexpectedly good night&#39;s sleeps. and as you sit there, squished into a probably-too-tight space with probably-too-many people playing a probably-too-long game, you wonder whether this was what school really was for. your mind dismisses this idea as absurd: even though this is a part of it, surely school&#39;s main objective is the classes you take and the knowledge &amp; experiences you gain, right? surely the point is to leave knowing more than you did earlier, being more prepared to contribute to the world, right? but maybe the way to become a better member of society lies in forming communities, in building bridges not only over the sea of knowledge but over the ocean of humanity—connecting together infinitesimal islands into tight-knit networks, trade alliances that develop their individual constituents as well as the transcendent whole?

you think about this as you play, pondering the many scales of connection as you endeavor to stem an outbreak in a single city while planning in parallel to prevent epidemics across continents and preclude an untimely global catastrophe. you think about this as you sit, moving pieces on a board that will soon be swept away into a box and stored in a cabinet, with people who will soon go their separate ways and vanish into the thick fog of homework and various evening activities. you&#39;ve come to terms with this transience, this seemingly ubiquitous aversion to stasis, because it strikes you now not as a curse, but merely as a natural extension of the incessantly quickening pace of the world, a reality you know all too well. even your friends, the people who anchor you to an existence that would otherwise be held in place only by an address and a resume, are not exempt from this imperative, as much as you wish they were. time plays no favorites, makes no concessions. but you&#39;ve got nothing else to turn to, because the steady ticking of time is the only constant in a world constantly in motion.

somehow, through roughly equal parts luck and skill, you and your friends manage to win. as you&#39;re cleaning up, you get a call from one of the people who takes the bus with you—it&#39;s outside, and will leave in a few minutes. you rush to get your things together and say goodbye to your friends. as you&#39;re hugging them, your heart jumps, and you realize that you really don&#39;t want to leave. you know you need to go, but you want nothing more than to stay here, to forget that you need to go home, to save yourself from once again being swallowed by the forests that surround your neighborhood. you want nothing more than to run away from another night of work, another night without your friends. you hug them tighter.

you&#39;re interrupted by another call. the bus driver is getting impatient, your friend says, and will leave in the next sixty seconds if you don&#39;t make it out there. reluctantly, painfully, you get up and say goodbye. as you&#39;re walking away, you look back and wave one more time. your friends are setting up for another game, and as you make eye contact, you almost turn around to go back and hug them one more time. but you can&#39;t. closing your eyes, you turn back around, and break into a run. run, run, run. you&#39;re almost [[out of time-&gt;afternoon bus after friends]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="84" name="afternoon work history" tags="" position="2150,2075" size="100,100">tonight&#39;s reading is about the civil war. and as you read, words and sentences and paragraphs chronicling the slow and painful division of a nation and the excruciating task of stitching it back together, you can&#39;t help but draw the parallel. you know what you&#39;re experiencing is nowhere at all close to the magnitude of destruction and injustice that characterized that period in history, but that doesn&#39;t prevent your mind from getting ideas. 

you read slowly, taking in a sequence of events whose outcome you have the benefit of knowing, watching the names on the page debate and negotiate and threaten and provoke, linguistic figurines playing a tactical game whose conclusion is long foregone. 1857. 1858. 1859. 1860. and

the wall bursts. a deluge of water envelops your mind, bringing a thousand time streams with it. you are inhumanly alert, attentive to every single parallel path, simultaneously experiencing a sliver of a thousand realities, each of them vividly real, as if they all could have happened had you made one different choice.

...

a call jolts you awake. one of the other people on your bus alerts you to the fact that the bus is here, and the driver&#39;s going to leave in two minutes if you don&#39;t show up. you silently berate yourself for not setting an alarm, but as you close your book and make note of where you are, you&#39;re pleasantly surprised to see that you&#39;ve actually read quite a few pages—you only have about a quarter of the reading left to do. you know it&#39;ll come back to bite you later, because of course it will, but you take what you can get. and before your mind returns to full power, you zip up your bag and leave the library. as you bolt for [[the bus-&gt;afternoon bus after work]], your legs cry out, having barely recovered from the day&#39;s frenetic pace—but, as it often does, adrenaline numbs the pain.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="85" name="afternoon bus after work" tags="" position="2275,2075" size="100,100">you manage to make the bus, breathlessly apologizing to the driver as you drop your bag and put your seatbelt on. you hang your head, not saying anything, as the driver wordlessly pulls away from the pickup circle—because any explanation, any excuse, that you could give wouldn&#39;t be enough.

even though you&#39;ve known the other two people on the bus for years, nobody usually talks on the way to or from school, each of you absorbed in your own intersecting but distinct worlds. you are no exception, and as the mile markers on the highway zip by, their speed seeming to warp as you pass them, time bends over backwards and envelops you. the one instance where you want it to run forward, to speed up and obscure this evening in frenetic motion blur, it refuses.

even though you should be thinking ahead, planning and mentally preparing for the rest of the evening&#39;s tasks, you can&#39;t help but think about your friends. while you retreated back into the library, they probably played a board game, taking some time to wind down. you don&#39;t even know if you should have gone and joined them, because you wouldn&#39;t have gotten as much work done, and besides, in the state you&#39;re in, you probably would have ruined the atmosphere, punctured a hole in the delicate bubble they&#39;d temporarily created, allowing the biting winds of life to rush in and disturb their momentary reprieve. perhaps from lack of it, you know how important that time is, and in some ways, you&#39;re glad you didn&#39;t risk taking that away from them—but nonetheless, you find yourself wishing more than anything that you chose to enter that bubble for a little while, to give your ears a break from the deafening wind, to spend just a few minutes with your friends. but, your mind points out, in the large scheme of the days, weeks, months that blend into each other, will these few minutes really matter? would a few hours even matter? logically, no, you think. then, why do you yearn so strongly for these ultimately insignificant blips in the infinite waveform of time? but, then again, why do you spend hours finishing your homework, when in five years, nobody will care whether you did that one assignment? and, by the same logic, why do you forsake other responsibilities to get a few hours of sleep, if two decades from now you and your body will have long forgotten that you did? time is playing tricks on you, because your mind&#39;s nearsighted eye has never been good at conceptualizing scale. you&#39;ve always subconsciously collapsed the future into an amorphous blur in front of you, and that&#39;s helped you stop fixating on it, but... maybe you should be thinking about it a little more. maybe it would help you better understand how time flows in the big picture, because soon enough, you&#39;ll grow big enough to start entering that picture, and what will you do? maybe you should start figuring out what you want to do after high school and how you&#39;ll fit into society and where you&#39;ll be ten years from now and how a mostly clueless high schooler like you will make an impact on such a big world and...

this is why you blur out the future. you&#39;re racing toward it too quickly to worry about what&#39;ll happen when you get there, because if you do, you&#39;ll be too late. if you do, it&#39;ll pass you by, and what will you do then?

as if responding to your thoughts, the lights flicker to life on the bus, and the door opens. a familiar gust of cold air floods the interior, and the faint lights of your house are barely visible through the window. this is your stop. reacquainting yourself with reality after having vanished into your head for so long, you pick up your bag and walk out, thanking the driver on the way. alone, you walk up your driveway, hands in your pockets so they don&#39;t freeze in the cold. you slip into the house, go upstairs, dump your bag on the floor near your desk, collapse into bed. it&#39;s not late, but you feel so tired. whatever time you had remaining in the day, you left in that lounge with your friends, even though you were never there—for even the minutes are clinging onto the prospect of being spent in joy rather than exasperation. strangely, the pull of unfulfilled obligations seems weak now, weak in the face of gravity pulling you to the bed. you lay there, face up, staring at a blank ceiling and a starless void outside your window, no sun to prove that time is still passing. you lay there, questioning what, how, when, and most pressingly, why. why?

you don&#39;t know. you never have. but you feel like you should.

you turn over, your face planted against the blanket. the final question comes to your mind: who? who are you to dismiss your obligations like this? you brought these feelings upon yourself when you decided not to be with your friends, and wasn&#39;t that a good decision? two hours ago, you trusted yourself to carry the momentum through and make the choice worth it, and who are you now to betray that trust? this wouldn&#39;t be the first time you&#39;ve betrayed yourself, of course—but does that mean you should do it again?

opening your code editor, you look back at the problem you got stuck on earlier. you try to clear your mind and think about it, send your brain down its multitudes of paths in the hope that one of them will lead to a glimpse of a solution. but tracking all these parallel traversals, keeping the eager tendrils of your consciousness from snaking away out of control, is no easy feat, and you aren&#39;t in the right state of mind for it. normally, this process is exhilarating, the ability to explore a problem from all sides at once, but you&#39;re not enjoying this as much as you should... and although you&#39;re willing to put enjoyment aside to finish this—after all, you&#39;re only here because you chose to be with your friends earlier—you also know that you can&#39;t do this if your mind insists on wandering elsewhere.
you stare at the problem, thoughts bubbling to the surface and quickly retreating as you see nothing at the ends of the paths they suggest. you close your eyes, building a mental representation of the core question, trying to send out probes in every direction you can think of. they go, propelled by a frustratingly weak force of will, but propelled nonetheless. your mind rapidly switches perspectives, scanning their trajectories for signs of an end, taxing its already worn-down faculties. and then it stops. the probes lose their propulsion, spiraling into chaos. you open your eyes, having traveled so many paths and found no closure, and involuntarily let out a sigh. it becomes painfully evident, as you stare at the static code on your screen, that one mile traveled on each of a hundred roads gets you no closer to the end of the marathon.

you should probably give this another attempt, you think, berating yourself for letting distractions cloud your vision. you made a contract with yourself when you went to play Pandemic with your friends, and even though you probably could put this off until tomorrow, you know you really should do it now so tomorrow doesn&#39;t become a disaster like this morning was. but tomorrow is so far away...

the street slopes slightly downward as you get closer to the lake. you&#39;ve been taking walks down this path for as long as you can remember, craning your neck with awe at the trees that reach so much higher than you could ever touch, sending out bifurcating branches to colonize an unfeeling sky. and though so much has changed in these years, the trees stubbornly remain, anchored to the ground by root networks that occasionally burst through the pavement as little reminders of the primacy of nature. and this lake too, though its waters swell and shrink with the rainstorms and dry spells, has stayed in its place, its waters sparkling just as brightly on a sunny 30-degree winter morning as a searing summer day. this little ecosystem is your refuge from the constant turbulence of the house, your fresh air away from the closed circulation of a home that can sometimes feel suffocating in its expanse. and at the bend in the road, you veer off onto the grass-covered path to the lake, vanishing into the trees.

not even a minute later, you stand overlooking a glistening oblivion expanse of water, minuscule waves catching ghostly reflections of the rising moon&#39;s stolen light. daylight is fading ever more rapidly now, and you can only barely see the outlines of the oaks and conifers that frame the far shore, the scraggly forms of the long-dead trees that once flourished on the island in the lake&#39;s center, the silent whisper of a biting wind snaking its way through the tangled forest and the lake at its center. you walk onto the footbridge over the short sequence of rapids that separates the lake from the feeble river into which its waters flow, and as you gaze out at the rushing waterfall below and the calm lake that extends beyond it, you can&#39;t help but let out a little laugh. because, well, what&#39;s not to laugh about?

you venture further into the forest. swallowed up by dense clusters of trees, a cellulose jungle of interlocking branches, the sounds of the world are increasingly drowned out, and you&#39;re left alone with yourself, left alone to think. about school and homework and all those things, which seem so insignificant now, so far away. about the future, about where you&#39;ll be in one year, in five, in ten, in fifty. about what would happen if you just said, to hell with it all, and just kept walking, further and further into the enveloping canopy of these trees, further away from everyone and everything. would anyone notice? would anyone look for you? would anyone hear if you fell, listen if you screamed?

you keep walking. the outside world slowly slips away, leaving only trees in every direction, rough brown husks furrowed with the marks of hundreds of weathered seasons. your legs carrying you ever further inward, you look up and see buds poking out of these now-lifeless branches, bursting open into flowers saturated with full-spectrum hues that give way to leaves, unfurling into a rich canopy that bathes the forest floor in a lime-tinted glow. you see the sun poking through these leaves, lighting up lucky pockets of the undergrowth, making the trees stand taller and wildflowers proliferate underneath, and then the hues change, the dark green shifting to incendiary red and orange and yellow, the leaves slowly falling to increasingly aggressive winds, scattering to the ground to join their ancestors of autumns past, you walk on these leaves, your feet treading over decades of history, and you see the trees return to their barren state, their branches stripped of life, expectantly waiting for the time when their buds can venture out once again. and as the marked path ends, you find an opening in the trees and continue on, because you don&#39;t know why you would return to the world when you can be here, watching time pass by around you at its surreal speed, a soundless slipstream in sublime stasis.

the seasons cycle on, dark brown to pink and purple to green to red and orange. you wander through space and time, a four-dimensional traveler with no particular destination. but all timelines must collapse, and eventually, you emerge from the trees, and begin the uphill walk back to the house. it&#39;s not very long, but the pavement stretches out in front of you, too uniform for comfort. the sky is devoid of branches now, and even as the stars glitter in pockets of coordinated light, its openness makes you feel vulnerable, unprotected, raw. the gusts of wind are so much more forceful out here, scarcely scattered by the few trees on the side of the road, and the moonlight is scalding, beaming down with a force unhindered by branches that seemed to absorb all light and reflect back only darkness.

you reach the house and open the door. the light takes you by surprise, such a contrast from what your eyes have now become used to, but your pupils adjust quickly. passing by the living room, you dart straight for your room, slipping by the rest of the family as they eat dinner. and when you get into the room and look at the time, your heart begins racing, as you realize how long you&#39;ve been out. you&#39;ve already lost a significant portion of the night - it&#39;s been nearly three hours.

you sink into your chair. what else is there to do now, but get back to work?

you don&#39;t know, so you figure you should [[get to it-&gt; work after walk]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="93" name=" work after walk" tags="" position="2775,1925" size="100,100">after so long outside, your mind harbors no thoughts. but that blank slate is now ravaged by nagging guilt, washing over you with the force of three hours of wasted time. you know that the time wasn&#39;t really wasted, that you needed to clear your head, that you needed some time to just be with the water and the trees and the silence—that despite the dread of introspection and of being alone with your own mind, you needed it, because with all your mind&#39;s constant optimizing and planning and calculating, you&#39;ve never had time to think.

but, of course, you can&#39;t do any work. your mind is still in the trees, still on the barely-delineated path through the forest of chirping crickets and scurrying squirrels and racing rabbits, still out by the lake watching the calm water accelerate from sparkling stasis and tumble down a waterfall in coordinated chaos. and maybe that&#39;s okay. maybe it&#39;s alright for you to allow your mind to wander sometimes, to satisfy its constant urge for exploration without being restrained by the directives of your oppressive internal task scheduler. maybe it won&#39;t kill you to let your mind out from under the shadow of schoolwork, because there&#39;s a whole lot more out there for it to think about.

but it&#39;s not okay. of course it&#39;s not okay. your task scheduler has never once in your life relinquished control, and why would it be okay to wrest the helm from its omniscient grip now? what would happen to you without that impossibly efficient machine meticulously organizing your swirling miasma of thoughts into some semblance of coherence? in all of its impossible efficiency, though, as you witness time and time again, your scheduler is infinitely flawed—and why would you place such absolute power in the hands of something so fallible?

logical systems promptly disintegrate when they encounter a contradiction. and though you&#39;re anything but logical, you feel these paradoxes tugging at you, forces shunning the laws of physics and pointing in multiple directions at once. and simultaneously, your task scheduler, whether responding to the lapse in logic or the subconscious suggestion that it might be overridden, shuts down.

with nothing left to sculpt its streams of consciousness, your mind regresses to its natural disorder.

lying in bed, staring up at the drywall and out at the dimly lit forest beyond your window, you consider the day. with the scramble of the morning, the conversations had and evaded, the choices made and forsaken, you can&#39;t help but be amazed at the staggering number of ways this day could have gone. you look up at an impossibly intricate tree of timelines, a sea of infinitesimal decision points delineating its countless branches, and your mind&#39;s eye darts around hopelessly trying to catch a glimpse of the extent of it all—though, of course, it can&#39;t.

you think of everything you did, and everything you didn&#39;t. what your advisor said was right — you can&#39;t do it all, no matter how hard you try. you feel like you&#39;re no closer to becoming at peace with that fact, but maybe today has taught you something, moved a hidden lever buried deep down somewhere in the workings of your task scheduler. maybe after many more conversations, many more days where you&#39;re confronted with the impossibility of your stubbornly held goal, you&#39;ll finally let go of it, finally be able to sit down and take in the already warm glow of the fire you&#39;ve set alight rather than constantly yearning to ignite its blaze ever brighter.

you think of everything you did, and everything you didn&#39;t. frustration comes over you as you confront the impossibility of your stubbornly held goal, an impossibility that you&#39;ve faced many times but that never seems to change your behavior. even now, shut down, your task scheduler exerts its influence, its machinery inexorably programmed to constantly ignite your internal flame, restlessly pumping air into its bellows and triggering cascading conflagrations that sweep you up in their irresistible blaze. the heat scorches you, egging you on further and further, because why would you ever take a break, sit down and take in the already warm glow of this fire you&#39;ve nurtured? why would you ever stop making it burn brighter?

you really can&#39;t do everything. you tried, you really did, taking every opportunity that came up to spend time with your friends despite the guilt pulling you away with increasing force. of course, this has left you with a pile of work, the crystallized cellulose corporeal form of that unendingly stubborn specter of guilt, and you don&#39;t even want to look at your desk to see how many things you&#39;ll have to do tomorrow morning. but, you think, it&#39;s worth it. because would a few scarce minutes of extra work time have really mattered? would you have been productive sitting there thinking about what could have been, thinking about being with your friends instead of curled up, alone, over frustratingly impersonal words and numbers and symbols? would it even have been useful to make yourself brute-force through your education like that? you don&#39;t think so. and even as all of your brain rebels against itself for thinking this, amid the chaotic sea of thoughts, one coherently flowing current forms: the conviction that you&#39;ll be fine. because even though you&#39;ll have more work tomorrow, even though you&#39;ll need to run faster tomorrow because you allowed yourself to stop and catch your breath, you got to be with the people you love. you got to be happy, just for brief moments — not the kind of superficial happiness that comes with a good grade or award or compliment, but something much more meaningful, much deeper. you got to belong, to care and be cared for, to connect, to love. and beyond scores and assignments and due dates, maybe that&#39;s all that matters.

[continue]

you look out of your window again. your curtain is open, enough for you to see the moonlight filtering through the trees outside, chaotically scattering onto the frozen ground. you know that if you don&#39;t close the shades, the sun will awaken you early tomorrow morning, and although you so badly want those extra minutes of sleep, and you know you&#39;ll want them more in the morning, you leave your curtains open. because responsibility is responsibility, and you&#39;re not about to shirk it.

you rest your head back on the pillow and close your eyes. thoughts dance across your mind, brush strokes on a blank canvas, stochastically creating pieces of art then wiping them away just as quickly. possible realities flicker into view, then disappear as instantaneously as they arrived, ephemeral glimpses you&#39;d rather not hold onto. and as today flashes by in fragmented filaments, you slowly begin to piece together your little fraction of the tree of timelines, extending backward to lunch, this morning, yesterday, last week, and stretching forward into tomorrow, the day after, next week, next year. it&#39;s blinding.

hope is the ability to imagine timelines. you&#39;ve never been the best at hoping, but now, you strive to construct the tomorrow you want, need, to have. and maybe, just maybe, you can do it, but hope&#39;s deeply intertwined companion is disappointment, the feeling of looking at another timeline whose branch point you&#39;ve already passed and realizing that it&#39;s gone. with the power to create worlds comes the necessary reality that you won&#39;t be able to inhabit them all, and maybe that&#39;s okay. because you can&#39;t traverse every timeline, but maybe exploring the ones you can inhabit, without allowing the inky oblivion of all that disappointment to trickle and flow and rush into the paths you&#39;ve hoped into existence, is all that matters.

it has to be.

your eyes open slowly, forced from sleep by the sheer force of a cacophony of all-too-familiar sound waves. through the gap in the curtains in your room, you see the glassy obsidian of a night sky behind a window panel, just as dark as you left it mere hours ago.
